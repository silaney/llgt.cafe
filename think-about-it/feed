										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The power went out some time after 7:30 AM. I found out some time around 8 AM. It seems that the rain caused a tree limb to droop down low enough to hit a power line.</p>



<p>It’s an easy fix for the power company. But if I hadn’t seen the power company truck, I would not have known.</p>



<p>What if the power weren’t back on. What would I do if the power outage were more widespread? After a tornado hit neighboring towns a little over 2 years ago, the place where I work lost power for three days.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I have backup lights, and that’s a good place to start. But that’s only a start. I can’t make my instant coffee and, if the power were still out, I wouldn’t want to open my fridge.</p>



<p>So, what is it that I need if the power goes out for an extended time — say, a week or more?</p>



<p>Light<br>Light comes in handy. And, if you have light, it helps to see what you are doing. Along with that is the batteries to power that light.</p>



<p>Water<br>Water may be next, if the water fails to run. LifeStraws are also a good source of clean water. They filter water that is not drinkable and makes it drinkable.</p>



<p>Sheler<br>Assuming that there is no structural damage, as in an earthquake or tornado, some form of protection from the heat or cold may be needed. A battery powered fan may be useful. Extra blankets can also help; sleeping bags work, too.</p>



<p>Food<br>Canned goods may be important. Try to stick with things that you know that you will use, whether in an emergency or not. If you won’t eat it before it expires, you probably shouldn’t buy it.</p>



<p>Planning<br>This includes making plans of what to do if the power goes out. You may check to see if there is still radio. If there is, great. If not, wait. Phone service may or may not work. Check the weather to see if it is raining. You may also check to see if anyone else is without power. If they have power, it’s likely that the problem is in your home or apartment. If you know your neighbors, you may be able to help them with their needs.</p>



<p>Planning can help with a lot of issues in an emergency, such as a power outage. But it can’t solve every issue that might arise. I find that prayer goes a long way, too. In an emergency, teamwork goes much further. It’s a win-win situation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Who am I to write about the heart of God? Who do I think I am? Oh, but it’s not really about me. It’s about God.</p>



<p>You may think of it this way. You are entering an intersection and you see a stop sigh. You may stop at that stop sign, or you may decide simply to slow down. After all, there are other cars approaching the intersection, and simply slowing down seems okay. You don’t say to the stop sign, “What right have you to tell me what to do.” It’s simply a sign.</p>



<p>Say, now, that you are entering another intersection. This time, however, there is a clearly marked, clearly visible police car parked near this intersection. I would venture to guess that you (and I) would be more careful to make sure that we stopped at that stop sigh.</p>



<p>Do I know everything about God? Certainly not. Nor can I know everything about you, partly because I don’t have all the answers regarding my own life. Yet, I walk in a relationship with the living God, not because of anything that I have done, but because of the things that God has done. I, by no means feel worthy to write about the heart of God, but I believe that He has put this on my heart. So, it is by faith that I begin writing. And I am trusting God, though His Spirit, to guide me each step along the way as to what I should and should not write.</p>



<p>No, I’m not a stop sign and this material is not designed to make or even to help you stop doing something. Rather, think of it as one of those signs that point you to the highway that you need to take, the gas station where you need to stop or to the hospital that you need to visit. As with any sign, we all need help getting to the place(s) that we need to go. I believe that God gives us signs — that all of creation is one big sign pointing to Him. I also believe that God gave us His written word, the Bible, to point us to Him. And that is what I will base my writing on.</p>



<p>You may or may not agree with the things that I write. However, like the stop sign, I do not care what you may think of me. But the one in the police car may care what you do.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong. God is not waiting for us to mess up so that He can punish us. The truth is that we all have a problem called sin and death. This sin, because of who we are and who God is, separates us from God. God could have said, “Oh, well, they get what they deserve.” But that is not the heart of God. God would not and could not simply let us perish. He loves us too much to let that happen.</p>



<p>There is much that I will not write about. After many years of study and just plain listing to others, I am certainly ware of many of the different views on everything from creation to eschatology (the study of end times). My goal is not to show you that I am right. My goal is simply to let you know or, perhaps to remind you, that God loves you, whoever you are or however you may see yourself.</p>



<p>John 3: 16 (KJV) tells us, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</p>



<p>Oh, I still have questions. And there have certainly been times when I’ve had doubts — even about the love of God in my life. There have even been times when I felt as if I were on of God’s “Oops — how did that get through?” Trust me, my life is no mistake and neither is yours.</p>



<p>I hope this writing is a blessing: a blessing for both you and for me. By this, I don’t mean that God will give us the riches that we desire in this life but that we will be blessed riches of a relationship with the living God — the only one who can give us eternal life. Don’t break out the hats for the pity-party just yet. God has a plan for each of us, for this life and beyond. God loves you and me; that’s reason to celebrate.</p>

<p>What is it that we actually need? For me, it’s food, shelter, clothing, transportation, work, relationships and and personal items. But if you look at where I live, you might think that I need a lot more than just that.</p>



<p>A whole industry has popped up called self storage because of all of the things that we think we need. These self storage units aren’t cheap but they can’t seem to build enough of them. Some people have so many things that they buy their own unit and keep it on their property. If a home isn’t enough, you can build a separate building.</p>



<p>Why do we want or need so many things? Personally, I think it helps us fill in some of the holes left by a lack of relationships — the most important one being a relationship with our creator. If we can just get enough things, maybe we will be happy. What we really need is to know the God who created us.</p>



<p>The Bible tells us that God loves us so much that He sent His Son to die on a cross so that we might have eternal life. Jesus warned us not to spend too much time collecting things on earth because these things don’t last.</p>



<p>So, my camera, is it a want or a need. For me, having a camera is a high priority want. I could choose any camera that I want but it has to fall within my financial means. I chose a digital camera because I don’t have access to a darkroom. Photography helps me be creative and I think that’s important. Will that last into eternity? Probably not. But I enjoy it now.</p>



<p>I’m not suggesting you sell your belongings. But it is good to think about the things that really matter from time to time. What really matters to me? Relationships. I have my relationship with my Father in Heaven. But I could spend more time working on relationships where I am right now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Happy July 4th. Yesterday, I finished my first book in a series called “Letters from a Time Traveler.” It’s not much more than 3,000 words but, still, I’m excited about it. It comes on the heels of having finished my fourth LLGT Cafe magazine. And I’m certainly excited about that.</p>



<p>What gets you excited? Now, there are several things I enjoy: a long walk on a cool day, taking pictures, spending time with a friend or cooking a meal for friends are just some examples. However, few things really get me excited and finishing a writing project is one of them.</p>



<p>You probably already know that excitement produces endorphins in the brain and that is what makes us feel good. It’s too bad that these chemicals aren’t easier to produce. I think that social media can produce these chemicals, and that may be part of the reason that so many are addicted to social media. I consider myself a recovering addict.</p>



<p>Exercise is a better source than social media. Too many of us — myself included — get our “fix” on social media, passing by exercise or actual social interaction, and it’s sad. Real relationships involve risk. But relationships are worth that risk.</p>



<p>In the long run, exercise is much better than inactivity, even if it’s cooking a meal. I got one of those watches that tracks my activity. If I sit down too long, it lets me know. We don’t need to be excited all of the time. Unfortunately, if we don’t find it in things that we enjoy, then we are more likely to look for it in things that we would rather avoid.</p>



<p>So, what is it that gets you excited? For me, it’s the prospect of helping others.</p>

<p>I’ve seen protesters complain about this country. Now, I don’t care for most country music, but I’m speaking of the U.S.A. I’ve also seen one who espouses the Second Amendment. But this is where I differ: I don’t believe that the right to freedom of speech is a right. I believe it is a gift. I believe that God gave U.S. this gift. And He won’t take it back. He will not flaunt how much it cost Him. But, as with any gift, we have the right to exchange it, with or without a receipt.</p>



<p>For me, birthdays or holidays can be painful reminders of the past. But I do enjoy the occasional, well thought out gift. Even if it comes from the dollar store. Over the years, I’ve been gifted and have given many a gift. Some of them are listed below:</p>



<p>Books, letters, a car, coats, clothing, shoes, more books, travel, cameras, toys, gum, candy and, of course, money.</p>



<p>I couldn’t think of anything else. We all like these things, right? I know I do. But this isn’t a thank you letter to the senders, or an “I wish you would send more”. Nor is it a pat on the back.</p>



<p>Now, here are some more gifts that I’ve gotten: gifts that I have gotten and that others have been give:</p>



<p>Love, joy patients.</p>



<p>The list could go on. All of us want these gifts, right? I don’t. Patients require hard work. Joy takes twice the work. Love takes 10x the work. But these are the very things that God uses to draw us to Himself. These, according to the Bible, are the things that build in us the character of Christ of patients within us. This is God’s desire for our lives.</p>



<p>God can choose from either list. And He does. He gives us a little of each. Some cannot handle things from the first list, while others cannot handle things from the second list. So, God gives us gifts according to His will: according to our unique personality. He made us, so He knows us best.</p>



<p>Money will draw one person to God — knowing that it will make him or her realize that he/she cannot go it alone. Another may not be able to handle the gift of money well, so God doesn’t give that person that gift. The thing is that God will use every resource at hand to draw people to Him.</p>



<p>For me, it was loneliness, depression and anxiety, along with dyslexia and other things. When I heard the Gospel, I said, “Sign me up.” My only stipulation was that I not pray aloud. I was so shy. And I knew in my heart that God would hear my prayer.</p>



<p>Some 40 plus years later, I still have so much to learn. What it all boils down to is, I am a servant. Nothing more; nothing less. What are my gifts? One is the ability to listen. It’s free and travels well. Just be patient as you may have to repeat yourself a time or two. After that, I give up and nod. The second is a keen eye that can find the beauty in just about anyone or anything. The third gift is to overcome the past; perhaps, it is the hardest pill to take.</p>



<p>Think about it and ask yourself, “What gifts has God given me?” If you care to share, please, comment below.</p>

<p>Being single and on a budget, it’s hard to get vegetables into my diet. Don’t get me wrong, I love vegetables. But they are often packaged for a family, and fresh vegetables can have such a short shelf life.</p>



<p>It’s sad that a healthy diet can be so expensive. The price of organic and non-GMO is often higher than other foods, which can be loaded with chemicals, soy, as well as a number of ingredients that you need a degree in chemistry to understand.</p>



<p>Those who sell supplements may remind you that the soil that the produce is grown in has been overworked for years and no longer produces the nutrition that is needed to be of any benefit. Yet, I can’t afford to spend $50 to $100 or more on supplements.</p>



<p>I enjoy shopping the local health food stores, but I have no idea what 95% of the hundreds of supplements are meant to do. And it can be hard to get information because of the fear of making a health claim. And no one is going to do a clinical study on the benefits of cinnamon, because there’s no money in it.</p>



<p>On top of everything else, there are so many opinions then it comes to what we eat. Some times, it seems that no two “experts” can agree entirely on what we should include or exclude in our diet.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I don’t have an answer. Some times the best I can is to take the latest advice that I see on YouTube. Maybe I see something at the store that catches my attention, so I buy it. Or an informercial offers another “amazing product” that makes claims of being better than all the rest.</p>



<p>I don’t really have any answers. Perhaps in the future, I’ll be able to spend more time and money on eating healthy. Who knows, maybe I could get married and not have to worry about cooking just for myself. Instead, there would be other things to worry about. So my advice is this: be happy where you are at. Don’t worry about the things you can’t change, but work on things that you can. I don’t know about you, but that sounds like advice that I could put into practice.</p>

<p>It seems that I’ve made yet another mistake. Now, am I going to let it bother me? Likely. Am I going to shape how I see myself? Less likely. I know how this thing goes. I make a mistake, and depending on how bad it is, I think about it for a short or long while and then I set it asked to go on with my life. I never really forget, but I try to learn from my mistakes and move on.</p>



<p>I have learned, over the years, that who I am does’t change by every little circumstance. Adding a picture to a wall, a new couch, or a drawing to the refrigerator, these little changes don’t make the home. It’s the people who live in the house that make a home.</p>



<p>Now, I don’t watch much television, so I’m not sure of the latest trends. But I do remember a trend by news media to call people, at least in the USA, consumers. No, not people. And not even producers, but consumers. I’m not sure what they would call us, today.</p>



<p>A lack of a personal identity can lead to things like depression and to other issues. Depression can express itself in isolation, anger, and even in violence — towards ourselves or towards others.</p>



<p>One current trend seems to be to question who we are. Schools have already taught for years that we came from primordial ooze, that we have no creator, and that we have no greater purpose than to live for today. In fact, one popular preacher says that we can live our best lives, now. I’m sure I can work on improving this life, but my hope is that my best life is yet to come.</p>



<p>Genesis is clear that God created everything and that we are His creation. Our purpose and meaning come not from the latest trend, or even our last thing that we did but from the God who created us. At least they should. It’s up to us to decide whether we believe God or what we hear: what we feel. Psalm 139:14 says that, “I am fearfully and wonderfully made.” First John 4:19 (KJV) tells that, “We love him, because he first loved us.” Luke 12: 7 tells us that God knows us so well that He knows the number of hairs on our head. God made us, he knows us and, still, He loves us. How many of us could say that, either about ourselves or about others.</p>



<p>Our identity ought not come from what we do, what we own, or who we know. Our identity should come from the knowledge that God created us, not from apes, but in His image. And it should come from the belief that God loves us and has a plan for each one of us.</p>



<p>Now, I’m still going to make mistakes. But I try not to let it see how I see myself. Instead, I have to realize that we all make mistakes and that’s how we learn. I try not to base my value on what others say about me or even what I say about myself. I have a creator who loved me enough to send His son to die for my sins so that I could have the hope of eternal life, which is where I hope to live my best life.</p>
