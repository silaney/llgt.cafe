<p>Sometimes it’s nice to do something unexpected, for yourself or someone else. If you want to do something by yourself or with or for someone else, here are some ideas.</p>



<p>Go shopping, even if it’s just window shopping. It can be nice to just get out of the place you are at.</p>



<p>Take can unexpected trip. You can plan it ahead, throw a dart at a map or just go where the wind takes you. It can be a lot of fun to go somewhere that you’ve never been before.</p>



<p>Build something. Look around and find out what you have to work with and make something. It could be paper mache or wood. You could build something, carve something or decorate something.</p>



<p>Find a game to play, indoors or out. There’s everything form tic-tac-toe to horseshoes and it’s your choice.</p>



<p>Go out to eat or fix a fancy dinner. This may require a little more preparation depending on what you decide to do, but the result could be well worth it. If it is an option, enlist someone to help you.</p>



<p>Maybe one of these caught your attention. Or, perhaps you came up with your own idea. If so, please comment below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As an introvert, I understand what it’s like to try to make new friends. It can be really hard to meet new people. It can seem, at times, nearly impossible, especially when it seems that everyone is so busy, even if they are just checking their social media account(s). But there is hope.</p>



<p>If you can, put yourself in a social setting. Attend a conference, take a bus somewhere, go shopping or go for a walk in a place where you feel safe — like a mall.</p>



<p>It may take time, but find someone who looks familiar. Try to start a conversation. If it turns into a friendship, great, if not, maybe it will, later. Whether you are an introvert or not, friendships take time.</p>



<p>Introduce yourself and try to remember the other person’s name. Try to make the other person feel comfortable. Remember that the other person may or may not remember your name the next time — or even at the end of the conversation. Remind them of your name, or ask them to remind you of their name.</p>



<p>Humor works. I went up to someone in a store and said that I would dance with them to the music, but I wouldn’t want to embrace them. Even if you don’t immediately have a new friend with whom you can share your deepest secrets, at least you can share your smile with someone.</p>



<p>Finally, look for others who may share your interest. I attended a church where the men were more interested in talking about tractors than other subjects: not interested. Don’t look for people interested in talking about stamp collecting at a supermarket. Instead, join a stamp collecting club.</p>



<p>Yes, it can be hard to meet new people, but it’s not impossible. Try this: cover your mouth and say “impossible”. Now, take your hand and wad up the word before throwing up the word. There, you’ve just taken the word out of your vocabulary. Better yet, give it to God, for nothing is impossible for God.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Do you want some good news? I think it’s good, tough you are welcome to disagree.</p>



<p>Deuteronomy 23: 35-36 (KJV) says, “To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste. For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.”</p>



<p>You know what this means? For me, it means I don’t need to judge others or worry about doing so. And, really, I have desire to judge others. It’s too hard to tell who is telling the truth and who is lying. It’s too hard to tell the motives for any given acton. It’s nearly impossible to walk in someone else’s shoes.</p>



<p>No, I don’t know way I do many of the things that I do. So how can I expect myself to be able to understand why others do the things that they do? Answer: I cannot.</p>



<p>Say, for example, I have two children. Say that the two get into a fight and, when confronted, each blames the other. It would be a mistake to choose one over the other, but that is the tendency. Instead, both should be equally punished. Right?</p>



<p>Perhaps, or perhaps not. Maybe the best thing to do would be to help the two to find a way to work it out: to mediate a deal between the two. Far above what punishment could do, this could be a true life lesson.</p>



<p>I don’t know about you, but I am all too quick to judge other’s motives or intent. And, when I do, it can have lasting and negative effects on me and on my relationships.</p>



<p>There is, however, one thing that we can do. We can be open with each other. If something bothers us, we can say, this thing that you are doing makes me uncomfortable. It hurts me when you…..</p>



<p>We should avoid saying things like, “You are a bad person,” and “I don’t like you.” These are things that probably aren’t true, or may be true for a short time. Really, “I don’t like you” is just a way of saying “I’m mad, or sad, or both.”</p>



<p>Instead of judging, I can listen. I can ask questions and try to figure out what went wrong. I can also offer possible solutions. If a fix to the problem is found, great. If not, it may take more time. If no solution is found, maybe one person or the other just don’t want to admit that he or she may be wrong. But, again, it’s not possible for me to know with 100% certainty. Only God knows, and only God can judge the heart.</p>



<p>“Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, ‘Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord’” — Romans 12:19 (KJV)</p>



<p>What do I take away from this? I can and should be more patient — with myself and with others. I don’t need to judge others or their motives. I don’t even really need to judge my own motives. Now, if I need help with a matter, I should find out the best person to talk to. If I need medical advise, I should talk to a doctor. If I need to know how to spell a work, I find that Google works well. If I’m part of a fight, I should realize that I am part of the problem. And when I come to this realization, I should stop, step back and ask, “What is the real problem?”</p>



<p>What do you think? I think that this is good news. But you are welcome to disagree.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today is Collector Car Appreciation Day. Try saying that three times fast.<br>It’s not just about old or fancy and unique cars. A while industry has been built around the automobile. Globally, revenue from just the sale of cars, themselves, was about $31.5 billon, with a growth rate of about 8%. That’s a lot of money and outdoes most stocks on the US Stock Exchange.</p>



<p><br>Aside from the cars, there is petrol, oil changes, car washes, hotel stays, advertising fees, photographers and models. It all adds up, and this money goes out to local businesses.<br>My dream car is a Mercedes, convertible from the early 1980s. I will probably never own one, but it’s nice to dream. It would likely be deep blue with brown leather seats.</p>



<p><br>What is your dream car?</p>



<p>For me, it’s more than a dream of having a particular car. I’m more than happy with the car that I have: a 2017 gray Jeep. I’m even happier that I’m no longer driving a 1991 van: ugly in every way.<br>For me, the Jeep reminds me that things can get better, no matter how I may feel at the moment. It’s also a reminder that my God is my source and my provider. And, because of this, I don’t have to worry about tomorrow.</p>



<p>If I begin to worry, as I am prone to do from time to time, I can go from 0 to panicked in .60 seconds. But, if I keep my eyes on God, and His Word in my heart (mind), there is really nothing to fear.</p>



<p><br>How can we celebrate Collector Car Appreciation Day? It may depend on where you live. If, for example, you live in a rural community, it may be that you or your neighbor has one of these in his or her yard. You may be able find a collector car at a local car dealership. You can also find photos and posters online. And there are car magazines. Finally, there are toy, model and remote control cars.<br></p>



<p>Perhaps, just learning something new is what matters. Personally, I would say that hope is what matters. And, it matters where we put on hope. My hope is in God: the Father, Son and Holly Spirit. Where do you find your hope?</p>

<p>It can be hard at times to find something to write about. Motivation can be hard to come by and it can seem like the ink well of inspiration can be dry. There is still hope. There are things that we can do to come up with ideas.</p>



<p>For one, we can watch our favorite movie. Maybe there are some things that it can teach us and that we might want to write about it.</p>



<p>A walk might inspire us to write about something. I wrote a poem based on what I saw in the clouds and in the sky. It doesn’t have to be complicated. Some times we just need to write.</p>



<p>We can spend time with a friend or family member. We can talk, but it may be better if we just listen or ask questions.</p>



<p>We an brainstorm ideas of what to write about. Take five minutes just to write things down that might be of interest.</p>



<p>It’s not just true of writers. Painters and musicians can sometimes Ron low on inspiration. Some times we just need to get away from our craft for a while and experience life so that when we go back to the drawing board, so to speak, we fell refreshed. Other times, we just need to get at whatever we want to do. Inspiration can come with doing the work. Editing can come later.</p>

<p>When it comes to our finances, there are a few rules that we should keep.</p>



<p><strong>Plan ahead</strong><br>One of the best ways to save money is to plan ahead. Have a budget, and stick to it. Plan your menus, and only buy what you can afford. Look for sales ahead of when you might need to make purchases.</p>



<p><strong>Pay yourself</strong><br>Set money aside for your future self. Call if an emergency fund or a fun fund. Emergency funds should have anywhere from $1,000 to three months take home pay, or more.</p>



<p><strong>Keep it simple</strong><br>One of the simplest ways to budget is to cash your check and put the money into envelopes. You may have envelopes for rent, food, gas and so forth. Each gets either a certain amount of money, or a percentage of your pay. If, for example, you have $100 for food, you have to figure out how to make that money last until next pay day.</p>



<p>If you don’t know where to start, begin by writing out some of your goals. Make sure that these goals are realistic, and give them a deadline. Take a look at where you are, and figure out small steps that you can take to get to where you want to go.</p>



<p><strong>Reward yourself</strong><br>Each time you take a step towards your goal, or whenever you reach a goal, remember to reward yourself. It could be as simple as a little cheer. Congratulate yourself. Pat yourself on the back. These small rewards can make you feel better about the direction you are taking, and help keep you on the right path.</p>



<p>Don’t put it off; the sooner you get started, the better. Make commitments to yourself, and respect yourself enough to stick to them. Your future self just may thank you for it.  Do these things and never forget that God is the one who provides for all of our needs.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I used to wonder if an someone could build a group of businesses that work together to support a ministry that helps the homeless — and do so without having to ask for donations. I used to wonder if I could structure such a business. I wonder a lot of things, and like all of the others, it hasn’t happened yet.</p>



<p>There is, it seems, a county, somewhere, that is doing something similar. I’m pretty sure it’s too much for one person to do. Yet, there are business that are helping others while they (hopefully) make a profit. They aren’t asking for donations. Still, they are able to help others.</p>



<p>One such organization is COL1972, who gives part of its profits to help expectant mothers. They help save lives. You can read more about COL1972 in the <a href="https://llgt.cafe/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/April-2023-issue-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April 2023 edition</a> of LLGT Cafe.</p>



<p>Tom’s Shoes has long been dedicated to producing quality shoes. Their commitment is to donate one pair of shoos for every pair of shoes purchased. Tom’s is also investing in their local community and, according to their website, they have helped over a million individuals since 2006.</p>



<p>Tacos 4 Life has a similar strategy. For every meal that is purchased, they are able to provide one meal through another organization.</p>



<p>I heard of one restaurant that gave customers the opportunity to pay it forward by purchasing slices of pizza for others. A customer could buy a ticket and that ticket would be placed on a bulletin board for anyone who could not afford to buy their own pizza.</p>



<p>We don’t have to own a business to do good. There are countless charities that we can donate to. We can choose to support expedient mothers, we can help organizations like the Arbor Day Foundation, we can help children through <a href="https://www.compassion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Compassion International</a>, or we can hand $20 to the cashier at Starbucks to pay it forward for the next customer that comes along.</p>



<p>One thing is clear. Life can be hard. Some times we need help and we shouldn’t have to go at it alone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today is National Common Courtesy Day, and it is observed each year on November 21. There are several ways that you can participate.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Send a note to a friend or loved one.</li>



<li>Do household chores that you normally wouldn’t do.</li>



<li>Give someone flowers.</li>



<li>Rake someone’s yard.</li>



<li>Pick up trash on a walk.</li>



<li>Say “thank you” to the person who bags your groceries.</li>



<li>Say “hi” to a stranger.</li>



<li>Say “please” when you ask for something.</li>



<li>Use your manners when eating a meal.</li>



<li>Hold the door open for someone else.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are several ways to show common courtesy. And we could all think of a few. Unfortunately, it’s all too easy to miss at least some opportunities because, it seems, we are all so busy. If we’re not running to the next major event, we’re answering a text or checking social media. It seem “safer” to stay busy with social media than to risk putting ourselves out there to help others.</p>



<p>It’s called “Common Courtesy” because it probably was more common. There was no social media to lean on, and there probably weren’t as many things that “had to be done.” But when we realize all that God has done for us, courtesy is something that we want to show, common or not.</p>



<p>Even in the past, common courtesy was something that had to be learned. We aren’t born with this trait. In fact, when we are young, we tend to focus on our own needs. We must not only be told to be courteous, but we must see someone else be courteous. If someone tells us to be courteous and they themselves are rude, we’re not likely to “do as they say.”</p>



<p>Remember to show courtesy, and not only today, especially if little ones are watching. And don’t just be courteous out where others can see you. Common courtesy begins in the home.</p>

<p>Do you enjoy cooking, or is it a chore? Have you been cooking for some time, or are you still new at it? I enjoy cooking, especially for others. If I’m cooking for myself, I still tend to cook in large batches and put whatever I cook in the refrigerator to eat throughout the week.</p>



<p>If you don’t care to cook, however or, if you are still new at it, here are a few tips.</p>



<p>Start at the library. Depending on the size of your library, there may to cookbooks numbering in the hundreds. It is one of the favorite subjects for people to write about. What you are looking for is ideas and, maybe a recipe or two. My library is curb side service only, making it harder to brows the cookbook section, but I’m sure that if I go online, I could find a book to check out.</p>



<p>Speaking of online, there are a number of online resources. YouTube and Amazon are just a couple of them. YouTube will show you not only the things that you will need, but will nearly always show you step by step the directions for making whatever it is that you want to make.</p>



<p>One of the keys to learning how to cook is technique. Learning technique, such as creaming butter and sugar together as the first step to baking, can help a great deal in the cooking process. Practicing knife skills can also lend to more beautiful presentation in your cooking, and you can learn all of this, free, online.</p>



<p>Knowing what spices and spice combinations work, and using these spices in your cooking, can also add a great deal of flavor to your cooking. Nutmeg is a wonderful spice to cook with, but you need to know when to use it, and how much to add to your recipe. Because it is such a strong spice, you only want to use a small amount, usually around 1/8 of a teaspoon. The same is true for cayenne pepper, but you likely won’t use these two ingredients in the same recipe.</p>



<p>It’s important to know the difference between spices and herbs. While spices tend to go into a recipe at the beginning of the cooking process, herbs tend to go in near the end, or even after cooking has been completed. The flavor of spices changes over time, while the more delicate herbs tend to loose their flavor fairly quickly. The best way to learn how to use these items is though actual practice. That way, you can find out what flavors that you like most as well as which ones you don’t really care for.</p>



<p>Here are a couple of other tips.</p>



<p>Plan ahead. It will save you both time and money if you are able to plan your meals ahead of time. Yes, you can save a lot of time buying frozen dinners and ordering out, but a home make meal is likely to be a lot better for you, and just might taste batter.</p>



<p>When you are preparing a recipe, gather everything that you will need into one place. Familiarize yourself with the recipe and do your best to understand what you will need to do and when. Give yourself time, and try to make sure that you are not interrupted during the process. There’s little worse than having to leave what you are working on and returning to find out that all of your labor (and food) has been wasted.</p>



<p>Take your time and taste as you go. As noted above, spies can change over time. A little cayenne pepper may not taste so strong now, but given an hour or so will probably increase in intensity. Remember that you can always add more but you cannot take out. There are tricks to reducing heat and over salting, but it’s best to not make these mistakes in the first place.</p>



<p>Enjoy the process. You may cook for yourself, or you may cook for others. The food that took so long to cook may last only minutes, and those whom you cook for may or may not thank you for your efforts. Yet, if you can enjoy the process, from start to finish, then it can make all of your effort well worth it, especially if you can enjoy the results at the end.</p>



<p>Try finding someone else to cook with. Cooking with a friend or family member might be more fun.</p>



<p>If all else fails, read the directions. Find a recipe that you might be interested in cooking and look it up. There are almost always recipes online and YouTube is another source that can give you a visual demonstration of just about any recipe out there.</p>



<p>Finally, if you can and, unless you enjoy doing so, find someone else to wash the dishes. The cook shouldn’t also have to do the dishes. Yes, I’ve had to do the dishes countless times over my career in food services, but it is my least favorite part of cooking.</p>



<p>Perhaps you have some of your own ideas. If so, please feel free to share them below. Cooking can be a rewarding endeavor, but it can also be a lonely one. I would love to hear from you.</p>

<p>Feeling stuck. Not sure how to get out of the daily grind? Maybe you just want to try something different but aren’t sure where to start. Here are some ideas that may help.</p>



<p>Start small. Take a moment to write down a list of things that you would like to start doing: exercising, eating more vegetables, remembering to feed your dog, for example. Find a place to put this list where you can see this list each morning and throughout the day. I have mine on a dry eras board. If you want to walk each day, start out with a two to ten minute walk. On weekends, I may walk three hours or more, but I try to walk a little each day, even if it’s to the fridge.</p>



<p>Try joining a church, a church small group for larger churches, or a club. Volunteer for a local charity or for the library. There are so many organizations that can use volunteer help.</p>



<p>Seek a new job/career or get a second job. You may have to do this if you loose your current job for whatever reason. Hopefully, this doesn’t happen, but it happens all the time. It can seem like a good thing, but often, it does’t. Either way, put your energy into finding something new and, if possible, exciting.</p>



<p>Take up a hobby. There are so many to choose from. Just within art there is photography, watercolor, pastel, color pencil, charcoal, those little fluffy things and so much more. You may even want to take a class that can help you learn a craft and may help you meet others who are also interested in art.</p>



<p>Teach a class. I found a local store, Natural Grocers, that allows me to use their kitchen to teach a class. They also provide me with up to $100 groceries to use as a demo. They do have rules that I am required to follow but nothing too difficult. I’ve only done one class but another is scheduled for next month. Just make sure that, if you decide to teach your class that you know your subject. Curiosity helps, too.</p>



<p>Find others to go for walks with. There may be a local photography club, too, as well as writers and speakers clubs. You should be able to do a Google search for local clubs.</p>



<p>The greatest/best change in my life came when I put my faith in Jesus to pay my sin debt and restore a relationship with God. John 3:16 (KJV) tells us that, <strong>“ For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</strong> It gives us what we cannot earn and what none of us deserve: forgiveness, wholeness and eternal life. Some things, we get as soon as we accept God’s gift, while other things take a lifetime to change. A prayer of salvation is just the beginning.</p>



<p>Change can be hard at times, especially if it is forced on us. But it doesn’t have to be. It’s our decision as to whether we see change as a good or bad thing. Try to see it as a good thing. In one way, change will occur, with or without us.</p>



<p>Note: I’m not talking about some changes that others may try to force upon us. Even a lie can seem true if you hear it often enough. Keep an open mind to differing views and you should be able to decide what to think about differing issues on your own. Is there a write and wrong? In some cases, yes, but in others, no. You are the one who decides which is which, at least in your own mind. And this, too, may change over time.</p>
