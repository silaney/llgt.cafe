<p>Dear Diary,<br>This was today’s Bible verse: “Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence.” — Isaiah 64:1 (KJV)</p>



<p>To rend is to tear, but with a sense of urgency. It’s as if to say, “God, we need you now.” I find that, these days, I never stop needing God. I need him all of the time, whether I am conscious of my need or not.</p>



<p>Today is Never Give Up Day. It is a worldwide holiday aimed at helping individuals who are suffering from various forms of pain and grief. It is meant as an encouragement us to not give up and keep on going.</p>



<p>Today is also National Fajita Day as well as National Ice Cream Pie Day. And if I had known about either one of these in advance, I might have been better prepared to celebrate. Maybe next year.</p>



<p>Lord,<br>Help me to not give up, but to do it because I know that you are with me.</p>



<p>Help those who have suffered loss. Be with them and encourage them as they face yet another day with whatever it is they are suffering. Thank you that, as long as we are alive, you never give up on us.</p>



<p>May ever day be a day to celebrate because of what Jesus has done on the cross: redeeming me and giving me a future that is better and brighter that I can ever imagine. Thank you.</p>



<p>In Jesus’ name,<br>Amen</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There is a saying that hard times can either make us better or bitter. That is, the difficulties that we face can make us stronger in character or make us angry and, perhaps, make us more isolated.</p>



<p>There is another side to that. Hard times can either draw us to God or away from God. Whether we realize it or not, we are always moving in one direction or another: towards God or away from Him. And we either have a relationship with God or we don’t.</p>



<p>The good news, the Gospel, tells us that it’s easy to begin a relationship with God. John 3:16 tells us, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</p>



<p>It seems that everyone has difficulties at times, whether we believe in God or not, whether we have a relationship with God or not. Hard times are, it seems, just a part of life.</p>



<p>I was fourteen when I began my relationship with the living God thought Jesus Christ and what he did and who he is: born of a virgin, lived a perfect life, died on a cross, a ransom for my sins, and rose again. Jesus us as much God as the Father and the Holy Spirit: three in one. It’s not something I can fully, 100% understand, but I’m okay with that.</p>



<p>Some times, I look at the news, and I don’t understand the things that others are going through. The killing and such just seems beyond my comprehension. Wars just never seem to end and, when one does, there is another one around the corner. But for those who believe, for those who have a relationship with the living God, there is this promise: “And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.” — Romans 8:28 (KJV)</p>



<p>I have to admit that it took me many years to figure out how some of the events that took place in my life could work for my good, but I’ve begun to figure it out. Either that, or I’ve just decided to accept it by faith.</p>



<p>Which way are you headed, towards God or away from him? Do you have a relationship with God. If so, God’s Word promises that no one and nothing can take you away from him. I’m counting on that, because I’m still nowhere near perfect. But I am moving closer to God. And hopefully each day, with the help of the Holy Spirit, I’m becoming more and more like Jesus.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Did you know that today is National Gossip Day and that gossip can help you or your business make money? It’s true. I just wrote it, so it must be true.</p>



<p>No. Seriously, rumors and gossip don’t actually help you or your business make money. Quite the opposite is true; rumors and gossip can hurt your finances.</p>



<p>Mainly, gossip can cause you to make the wrong financial choices. Rather than knowing what is really going on, it’s possible to get inaccurate information from various sources. I don’t know how many times the stock market was going to crash — and it didn’t. I don’t know how many times banks were doomed and yet banks still exist. Predicting a market or a financial crash is like predicting the next “great” quake to hit California. Even when you think you know, you really don’t know.</p>



<p>Someone may say, “this business has done well in the past, so they are certain to do well in the future.” This may lead us to buy their stocks: stocks that may be doomed to go down because of information that I have not been given. When it comes to advise on buying stocks — or anything else — it’s best to get more than one opinion. For example, I no longer buy supplements on Amazon without getting more than one opinion.</p>



<p>How do we know what is a rumor or just plain gossip? It can be hard to tell. One way to know is if someone has to whisper it. Another way is if someone uses works like “could” or “might” but makes it sound more like “will”: this will help you make more money or will help you live a healthier life.</p>



<p>I remember seeing an add for magnesium that said that this product helped someone sleep much better. After buying magnesium from another source, I watched a YouTube video that said it can help a limited number of people. It seems that I wasn’t one of them. I didn’t spend a lot of money and I can still use the product. But it certainly hasn’t helped me sleep better.</p>



<p>Finally, rumors and gossip can hurt you, your relationships and your business. You may not be able to keep others from spreading rumors about you, but you can put an end to a rumor that goes your way.</p>



<p>In the end, gossip is no good and it can do nothing but hurt others, whether it be financially or personally. The Bible clearly warns against spreading rumors for that very reason. So, if you are tempted to spread gossip about someone, stop, and consider how you might feel if someone said the same thing about you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Do you want some good news? I think it’s good, tough you are welcome to disagree.</p>



<p>Deuteronomy 23: 35-36 (KJV) says, “To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste. For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.”</p>



<p>You know what this means? For me, it means I don’t need to judge others or worry about doing so. And, really, I have desire to judge others. It’s too hard to tell who is telling the truth and who is lying. It’s too hard to tell the motives for any given acton. It’s nearly impossible to walk in someone else’s shoes.</p>



<p>No, I don’t know way I do many of the things that I do. So how can I expect myself to be able to understand why others do the things that they do? Answer: I cannot.</p>



<p>Say, for example, I have two children. Say that the two get into a fight and, when confronted, each blames the other. It would be a mistake to choose one over the other, but that is the tendency. Instead, both should be equally punished. Right?</p>



<p>Perhaps, or perhaps not. Maybe the best thing to do would be to help the two to find a way to work it out: to mediate a deal between the two. Far above what punishment could do, this could be a true life lesson.</p>



<p>I don’t know about you, but I am all too quick to judge other’s motives or intent. And, when I do, it can have lasting and negative effects on me and on my relationships.</p>



<p>There is, however, one thing that we can do. We can be open with each other. If something bothers us, we can say, this thing that you are doing makes me uncomfortable. It hurts me when you…..</p>



<p>We should avoid saying things like, “You are a bad person,” and “I don’t like you.” These are things that probably aren’t true, or may be true for a short time. Really, “I don’t like you” is just a way of saying “I’m mad, or sad, or both.”</p>



<p>Instead of judging, I can listen. I can ask questions and try to figure out what went wrong. I can also offer possible solutions. If a fix to the problem is found, great. If not, it may take more time. If no solution is found, maybe one person or the other just don’t want to admit that he or she may be wrong. But, again, it’s not possible for me to know with 100% certainty. Only God knows, and only God can judge the heart.</p>



<p>“Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, ‘Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord’” — Romans 12:19 (KJV)</p>



<p>What do I take away from this? I can and should be more patient — with myself and with others. I don’t need to judge others or their motives. I don’t even really need to judge my own motives. Now, if I need help with a matter, I should find out the best person to talk to. If I need medical advise, I should talk to a doctor. If I need to know how to spell a work, I find that Google works well. If I’m part of a fight, I should realize that I am part of the problem. And when I come to this realization, I should stop, step back and ask, “What is the real problem?”</p>



<p>What do you think? I think that this is good news. But you are welcome to disagree.</p>

<p>What would your rather have?</p>



<p>A million dollars?<br>Free food for life?</p>



<p>A trip to Hawaii?<br>A trip to the country?</p>



<p>A free pass to any more for the rest of your life?<br>The ability to read any book in seconds?</p>



<p>A new car every year for the rest of your life?<br>A car that never needed repairs?</p>



<p>A personal chef for life?<br>A personal trainer for life?<br>The man or woman of your dreams?<br>To be the man or woman of someone else’s dreams?</p>



<p>A relationship with someone whom you think the be the most beautiful or most handsome?<br>A relationship of service and commitment to the other?</p>



<p>You might think that the last one is a trick question, but true, lasting relationships, thought they may begin with physical attraction, won’t last long if that’s all there is. That’s why so many relationships don’t last. A lasting relationship needs a commitment to the other person that goes deeper and seeks to serve and love the other.</p>



<p>“Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.” — 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 (NIV)</p>



<p>There’s nothing in that verse that talks about getting our own way or having things be perfect. In fact, if we keep looking for perfection, we will never find it. But if we seek to serve, whether it be others, or the God who created us, we will become more loving. And, as 1 Corinthians tells us, there is nothing is more important that we can do than love others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Who am I? It’s one of those deeper questions that we ask ourselves from time to time. And we may get a different answer each time.<br>I’m not entirely sure who I am. In short, I’m Ralph. I know who I’m not. I’m not the things I own, the people I know or the things that I have done. These things may help shape me, but they don’t make me who I am. Another thing I am not: I am not what I was and I am not yet who I will be.</p>



<p>I was 14 when I asked Jesus to be lord of my life, which was 43 years ago. After hearing the Gospel, I realized that I was a sinner and that God had sent His Son to die on a cross so that I might have eternal life.</p>



<p>Because I was so shy at the time, I couldn’t pray out loud. That has certainly changed. I’m no longer shy about praying out loud and some times as others if I can pray with and for them.</p>



<p>Anyone can become a follower of Jesus. We don’t have to live a particular lifestyle. We just need to have faith that Jesus can save us from our sins. Really, He is the only one who can. I cannot save myself from my sins. I put my faith in Jesus and God gave me eternal life. He also gave me the Holy Spirit to help guild me. If you like, you could say I’m born again.</p>



<p>What else is true? I am loved. I am fearfully and wonderfully made. I am a child of the living God. How about you? John 3:16 (KJV) says that, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” Are you a whosoever? I’m a whosoever.</p>

<p>How much is enough? It’s a simple question, right? Last night, I got about four hours sleep. I got to bed late and woke up early. For a few, this might be enough sleep. For me, it’s not. Fortunately, I did get a little more sleep after going to an appointment that I had, but it still doesn’t seem like enough.</p>



<p>But there are less needed things that make it harder to know when enough is enough. For example, I got another lens for my camera last week. It wasn’t all that expensive compared to most of the lenses that Canon sells and it fills a “need” that my other lenses don’t. But it’s not a need, it’s a want.</p>



<p>Similarly, there is a mixer on display at Sam’s Club that looks so nice. But it’s not a need or a want, at least not now. And I don’t have room for it in my kitchen. Really the list of things could go on.</p>



<p>Conversely, there are things that I have in my life from time to time that I would rather not have: frustration, irritation and loneliness, just to name a few. These are just some of the things that I would rather not deal with.</p>



<p>Did you know that, according to the Bible, it’s the latter things — the loneliness and frustrations — that draw us closer to or make us more like God? I know it, but it’s easy to forget, especially when we’re “suffering” these things.</p>



<p>So, what are we to do? For the first, it’s best to have a budget. It needs to be one that we can stick with, and it should be as close to our actual needs as possible. I say this because things like groceries can be hard to predict, unless we really work hard at planning both the budget and our diet.</p>



<p>For the other things, we can learn to deal with them. Breathing exercises — taking a long breath in through the nose, holding it for a few seconds and a long breath out the mouth can help. Just counting slowly to ten can also help.</p>



<p>You see, most of our life depends on how we see it. If we see getting a parking ticket as a bad thing, it becomes a bad thing. But if we are able to see it as building patients, it can become a positive thing; that is, if we want to be more patient. For now, I think there might be enough time for another nap.</p>

<p>It seems that peace, like many things, is in short supply. Peoples and nations are either in the midst of war or are either threatening or being threatened by another. It’s easy to forget the human toll of those who are being affected by these wars.</p>



<p>Each of us longs for peace. We want peace for our nation and peace for our souls. Yet, it is only in Jesus, the Prince of Peace, that we can actually find peace. The wounds of Jesus can heal us and it is by his blood that we are made clean. It’s only through faith in Jesus that we can see the Father.</p>



<p><strong>“For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” — Romans 3:23 (KJV)</strong></p>



<p><strong>“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” — John 3:13 (KJV)</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ephesians 2:8-9 (KJV) tells us, “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:Not of works, lest any man should boast.”</strong></p>



<p>We can look inside for peace. We can negotiate for peace. One day, Jesus will come, and he will put an end to all fighting. Until then, we can at least find peace with God the Father though faith in Jesus.</p>



<p>It’s pretty simple. Faith often asks us to do simple things and it’s often the simple things that are the hardest. A simple prayer like, “Father, forgive my sins,” may be all it takes if it is said in faith.</p>



<p>Real peace will come to the world one day. Till then, we can have a peace with God though his son, Jesus. I hope you find peace.</p>
