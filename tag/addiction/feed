<p><strong>Warming: the following material could be heartbreaking. If you like, you may skip to the end.</strong></p>



<p>At Some point of our lives, each of us is a victim. It may be a crime, such as theft or vandalism. It may be abuse: sexual, emotional or physical. For all too many, life begins and ends with the abuse known as freedom of choice. Most of us just fall victim to the results of our own choices.</p>



<p>Each persons behavior is based on what he or she sees in other, on television and in movies, or listens to in the form of others or the music that that individual listens to. So someone who has been hurt by others — “You’re such a dummy” — is more likely to hurt others. Crime, gossip and abuse don’t begin with the act, they begin with a though.</p>



<p>“Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.” — Matthew 5: 21-22 (KJV)</p>



<p>God is much more concerned about our thoughts — our heart — than our our intents. It’s not intentions that lead to action; it’s our thoughts. We do, however, have the ability to stop when we see a negative though forming in our mind. We can stop and think. Unfortunately, not everyone realizes that he can change his thought pattern. And it we constantly feed on violence and a thought of hatred enters our mind, violence is likely to ensue.</p>



<p>It is important who and what we listen to. Television and movies are often meant to instill fear. They cause us to laugh at the wrong thing — mainly sin and perversion. Music can cause us to believe the wrong things, and material found of the Internet can cause thoughts of anything from fear to jealousy and lust.</p>



<p>Just one statistic shows that “22% of individuals assaulted by a partner at least once in their lifetime (23% for females and 19.3% for&nbsp; males).” Unfortunately wether the perpetrator realizes his/her abuse or not, whether the victim realizes their abuse or abuser or not, most people lack the resources to do anything. The sad part is that all too many victims are too young to recognize abuse and certainly too young to express what they may have experienced. “This must be normal,” one tells himself.</p>



<p><strong>You can pick up here if you like.</strong></p>



<p>I think I’ve made my point. At some time, each of us a victim. Now comes the choice: we say “Yes, I am a victim, and I deserve to be angry, resentful or bitter. Where’s my phone? I need to call a lawyer.” But that’s not the answer. What we should do is turn to the Savior: our Great Physician.</p>



<p>You can start wit the book of John <a href="http://Book of John https://content.wtsbooks.com/shopify/pdf_links/9781433558955f.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(PDF)</a>. Or you can start with verses like:</p>



<p>“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” — John 3:16 (KJV)</p>



<p>“That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” — Romans 10:9 (KJV)</p>



<p>Faith is a process that begins as a seed, takes root in the Word of God and beings to grow. A relationship with our Savior isn’t a religion and it’s not something that we can do on our own. We need to go to God and simply trust in the finished work of Jesus, his death on the cross to pay for our sins and his resurrection. We need to believe that Jesus, born of a virgin, lived a perfect and sinless life, was both fully God and fully man so that he could save us from our sins and restore the relationship with God that you and I truly long for.</p>



<p>It may begin with a prayer like this: “God, thank you for sending your only son to die to pay for my sins. I’m confessing that I’m a sinner and I ask you to forgive me, not because of anything that I do, but because of Jesus’ precious blood, spilt on a cross to pay my sin debt.”</p>



<p>What next: Find a church that teaches the Bible: preferably only the Bible, and doesn’t try to fill your mind with self help books and platitudes. If you find such a church, become a member. Hint, if the church is growing, it may be a good church. Visit that church and listen to who and what they talk about. Baptism is important, but not a requirement and it doesn’t give anyone eternal life. Spiritual gifts are a matter for another time.</p>



<p>If ever you feel threatened by someone or feel that your life may be in danger and cannot say, “I need the police to come help me,” dial 911 and press send. When the operator answers, say, “Yes, I’d like to order a pizza.” The operator with know what to do.</p>



<p>There are also videos that can help victims of abduction and sex trafficking: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GfsS4HH2Uw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Link to video</a></p>



<p>Parents should talk to their kids about what victimization looks like. Don’t frighten then but give them ideas of what they might do if someone approaches them. Practice situations that your child may experience and, by all means, keep lines of communication open, which means that you may have to confess your own faults and failures. After all, there’s no better teacher than personal experience. And admitting our own failures won’t kill us or make us look likes less of a person — except to the one who is out to get us.</p>

<p>There is help out there. If you see someone who looks like she needs help, take time to get to know that person. Ask questions.<br>If you could go anywhere in the world, where would you go?<br>What’s you’re favorite sport, color, food…<br>What are your plans for upcoming holiday/weekend?</p>



<p>Finally, be a friend. Find someone who seems isolated.  Offer her a Pop-tart a smile and some encouragement.  Find out what kind of music he or she likes. Just start talking. Just show that you care. And smile. Keep your smile, it still works and it looks good on you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Last night, I gave all of my worries to Jesus. It felt really good. It’s not the first time that I’ve trusted God with my fears, but I don’t do it nearly often enough. The first time was after a major military exam. I had just taken it that day, and the failure rate was high. I was worried, but I decided to give my worry to Jesus.</p>



<p>Maybe you have some worries of your own. I’ve learned to avoid watching television. There is a TV at work and, other than the weather, it’s mostly filled with death and misery and other things that I just don’t want to dwell on.</p>



<p>Now, it wouldn’t do any good to give Jesus my fears if I hadn’t first trusted him to take away my sins. The Bible tells us that we have all sinned. Romans 3: 23 KJV) tells us that “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” I could try to convince myself that I’m not really that bad a person, but that wouldn’t take away the fact that, by God’s standards, we are all sinners. Yet, God, who created us, the God who will one day judge his creation, made a way.</p>



<p>Acts 16:31 (KJV) tells us, “And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.” If we put our faith in Jesus who, tough he was equal with God, put on flesh to pay for our sins, then we will have eternal life. “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” — Romans 10:9 (KJV)</p>



<p>It’s easy to forget, however, that the Bible also tells us, “casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.” — 1 Peter 5:7 (KJV).</p>



<p>It is, perhaps, these cares that we carry are behind many of the problems that we face today: poor health, both mentally and physically, as well as a number of addictive behaviors. We may want to stop doing something, but it helps us forget our problems, so we keep doing it. What if, instead, we gave our problems to Jesus?</p>



<p>It’s too early to know the long term results. I may have to keep giving my cares to Jesus, but I can do that. You can, too.</p>
