<p>Dear Diary,<br>This was today’s Bible verse: “Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence.” — Isaiah 64:1 (KJV)</p>



<p>To rend is to tear, but with a sense of urgency. It’s as if to say, “God, we need you now.” I find that, these days, I never stop needing God. I need him all of the time, whether I am conscious of my need or not.</p>



<p>Today is Never Give Up Day. It is a worldwide holiday aimed at helping individuals who are suffering from various forms of pain and grief. It is meant as an encouragement us to not give up and keep on going.</p>



<p>Today is also National Fajita Day as well as National Ice Cream Pie Day. And if I had known about either one of these in advance, I might have been better prepared to celebrate. Maybe next year.</p>



<p>Lord,<br>Help me to not give up, but to do it because I know that you are with me.</p>



<p>Help those who have suffered loss. Be with them and encourage them as they face yet another day with whatever it is they are suffering. Thank you that, as long as we are alive, you never give up on us.</p>



<p>May ever day be a day to celebrate because of what Jesus has done on the cross: redeeming me and giving me a future that is better and brighter that I can ever imagine. Thank you.</p>



<p>In Jesus’ name,<br>Amen</p>

<p>It’s a new day<br>One for which<br>I did not pay</p>



<p>It’s new to me<br>And new to you<br>what will we see<br>and what will we do</p>



<p>I do not know<br>Will I shrink<br>or will I grow<br>Shrink in fear<br>Or grow in knowledge</p>



<p>Will I be better today<br>Than I was yesterday<br>Or will I stay the same<br>Or grow in fame<br>Will I die to self<br>And learn to live<br>Will I keep<br>Or choose to give</p>



<p>Who knows<br>What the day will bring<br>Will it be different<br>Or the same<br>Is life a burden<br>Or is it a game<br>I give you my time<br>I sell it for a dime</p>



<p>Is it over now<br>Or just getting started<br>Will I glow bright<br>Or flame be retarded<br>Will I be a start<br>Shine from afar<br>Can you see my light</p>



<p>Can you see me fight<br>To resist myself<br>To lay in bed<br>And lay my head<br>And close my eyes<br>Or go instead</p>



<p>To go out<br>And change my world<br>To change myself<br>To be the same<br>Or build a shelf</p>



<p>To do something<br>For someone else<br>Of for myself<br>With someone else</p>



<p>To be alone<br>Or be with you<br>In mine own zoo</p>



<p>&nbsp;It is of the Lord&#8217;s mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness. The Lord is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. Lamentations 3:22-24 (KJV)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Do you want some good news? I think it’s good, tough you are welcome to disagree.</p>



<p>Deuteronomy 23: 35-36 (KJV) says, “To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste. For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.”</p>



<p>You know what this means? For me, it means I don’t need to judge others or worry about doing so. And, really, I have desire to judge others. It’s too hard to tell who is telling the truth and who is lying. It’s too hard to tell the motives for any given acton. It’s nearly impossible to walk in someone else’s shoes.</p>



<p>No, I don’t know way I do many of the things that I do. So how can I expect myself to be able to understand why others do the things that they do? Answer: I cannot.</p>



<p>Say, for example, I have two children. Say that the two get into a fight and, when confronted, each blames the other. It would be a mistake to choose one over the other, but that is the tendency. Instead, both should be equally punished. Right?</p>



<p>Perhaps, or perhaps not. Maybe the best thing to do would be to help the two to find a way to work it out: to mediate a deal between the two. Far above what punishment could do, this could be a true life lesson.</p>



<p>I don’t know about you, but I am all too quick to judge other’s motives or intent. And, when I do, it can have lasting and negative effects on me and on my relationships.</p>



<p>There is, however, one thing that we can do. We can be open with each other. If something bothers us, we can say, this thing that you are doing makes me uncomfortable. It hurts me when you…..</p>



<p>We should avoid saying things like, “You are a bad person,” and “I don’t like you.” These are things that probably aren’t true, or may be true for a short time. Really, “I don’t like you” is just a way of saying “I’m mad, or sad, or both.”</p>



<p>Instead of judging, I can listen. I can ask questions and try to figure out what went wrong. I can also offer possible solutions. If a fix to the problem is found, great. If not, it may take more time. If no solution is found, maybe one person or the other just don’t want to admit that he or she may be wrong. But, again, it’s not possible for me to know with 100% certainty. Only God knows, and only God can judge the heart.</p>



<p>“Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, ‘Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord’” — Romans 12:19 (KJV)</p>



<p>What do I take away from this? I can and should be more patient — with myself and with others. I don’t need to judge others or their motives. I don’t even really need to judge my own motives. Now, if I need help with a matter, I should find out the best person to talk to. If I need medical advise, I should talk to a doctor. If I need to know how to spell a work, I find that Google works well. If I’m part of a fight, I should realize that I am part of the problem. And when I come to this realization, I should stop, step back and ask, “What is the real problem?”</p>



<p>What do you think? I think that this is good news. But you are welcome to disagree.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Who am I? It’s one of those deeper questions that we ask ourselves from time to time. And we may get a different answer each time.<br>I’m not entirely sure who I am. In short, I’m Ralph. I know who I’m not. I’m not the things I own, the people I know or the things that I have done. These things may help shape me, but they don’t make me who I am. Another thing I am not: I am not what I was and I am not yet who I will be.</p>



<p>I was 14 when I asked Jesus to be lord of my life, which was 43 years ago. After hearing the Gospel, I realized that I was a sinner and that God had sent His Son to die on a cross so that I might have eternal life.</p>



<p>Because I was so shy at the time, I couldn’t pray out loud. That has certainly changed. I’m no longer shy about praying out loud and some times as others if I can pray with and for them.</p>



<p>Anyone can become a follower of Jesus. We don’t have to live a particular lifestyle. We just need to have faith that Jesus can save us from our sins. Really, He is the only one who can. I cannot save myself from my sins. I put my faith in Jesus and God gave me eternal life. He also gave me the Holy Spirit to help guild me. If you like, you could say I’m born again.</p>



<p>What else is true? I am loved. I am fearfully and wonderfully made. I am a child of the living God. How about you? John 3:16 (KJV) says that, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” Are you a whosoever? I’m a whosoever.</p>

<p>The things that I do today, the things that I do every day, especially the things that I do first thing in the morning are key to determining my future. What I do really does matter. Today, I plant the seeds that I will reap in the tomorrows to come. So, what is it that I do, or at least try to do first thing in the morning?</p>



<p>First, I read a bible verse. Psalm 143: 8 (KJV) says, “Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.”</p>



<p>I drink water, or lemon water, which helps refresh the bodies fluids.</p>



<p>I take vitamin D or a multi vitamin which can help mood in addition to having other health benefits.</p>



<p>I also listen to music. Right now, I’m listening to Audrey Assad. It’s calming and helps me to remember what really matters — a relationship with the living God.</p>



<p>Finally, I remember what I am thankful for: past, present and things to come.</p>



<p>This is what I do first thing. I also write, go for a walk and often take pictures. What is it that you could do first thing in the morning to help you get off to a good start? If you like, you can comment below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There is something that I have learned over the years. We cannot get rid of our problems that we face in life, and we cannot choose, for the most part, what problems we have.</p>



<p>Sure, we can make poor decisions in certain areas of our lives that lead to problems in these areas. Yet, we cannot choose our parents or how we are brought up. We cannot choose our genetics or the lessons that we are taught along the way.</p>



<p>Proverbs 22:6 (KJV) says, “Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.”</p>



<p>I’ve heard it said that much of what we learn, we learn by the time we are just two years old. Likely, what we learn at this age, consciously or not, affects many of our habits, our behavior and our relationships.</p>



<p>As we grow up, we hear things repeated, or we tell ourselves things over and over again. We learn to believe these things about ourselves. Sadly, many of the things that we grow to believe may not be true.</p>



<p>It is true that we cannot run from our problems. We can try. We can exchange one problem for another. Maybe the new problem with be better than the old one but maybe not. The important thing, though, is that we don’t give up and don’t quit.</p>



<p>Romans 8:31 (KJV) reminds us, “What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?”</p>



<p>No, we cannot run from our problems, but we can learn to face them with the God who created all things. And in spite of how things may look at times, nothing is impossible with God.</p>

<p>It seems that peace, like many things, is in short supply. Peoples and nations are either in the midst of war or are either threatening or being threatened by another. It’s easy to forget the human toll of those who are being affected by these wars.</p>



<p>Each of us longs for peace. We want peace for our nation and peace for our souls. Yet, it is only in Jesus, the Prince of Peace, that we can actually find peace. The wounds of Jesus can heal us and it is by his blood that we are made clean. It’s only through faith in Jesus that we can see the Father.</p>



<p><strong>“For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” — Romans 3:23 (KJV)</strong></p>



<p><strong>“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” — John 3:13 (KJV)</strong></p>



<p><strong>Ephesians 2:8-9 (KJV) tells us, “For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:Not of works, lest any man should boast.”</strong></p>



<p>We can look inside for peace. We can negotiate for peace. One day, Jesus will come, and he will put an end to all fighting. Until then, we can at least find peace with God the Father though faith in Jesus.</p>



<p>It’s pretty simple. Faith often asks us to do simple things and it’s often the simple things that are the hardest. A simple prayer like, “Father, forgive my sins,” may be all it takes if it is said in faith.</p>



<p>Real peace will come to the world one day. Till then, we can have a peace with God though his son, Jesus. I hope you find peace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jesus loves me, this I know.  Just that sometimes, I have to go real slow.&#8221;</p>



<p>The trend has long been to do more, faster and better than before. I think we all feel the pressure in some way to get more done. Yet, even God took a day off.</p>



<p>There are at least a few ways to take a step back from our work. We just have to figure out what works best for us.</p>



<p>Plan ahead to do nothing. It could mean that you plan to set aside a few minutes each day, or it could mean that you plan to take a full day off each week. It also means figuring out what you may need to do or to put off in order to take this time.</p>



<p>By doing nothing, I don’t mean that you have to lie in bed and not move. What I’m talking about may look like one of the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Take a nap.</li>



<li>Call a friend.</li>



<li>Journal.</li>



<li>Pray or pick up a Bible.</li>



<li>Draw, crochet, cook or something else.</li>



<li>Take a leisurely walk.</li>
</ul>



<p>These are just a few ideas. The thing is that some of us — myself included — have to plan things or else they just don’t happen. And, for me, even putting something on a to-do list dues’t guarantee that it will get done.</p>



<p>The thing is to do something that you will enjoy doing. And keep it simple. Don’t think, as I some times do, my neighbor’s lawn needs cleaning, so I’m going to take care of that. Yes, there is a time for these things, but it cannot replace taking at least a little time to replenish ourselves.</p>



<p>Can taking time off be taken to extremes? Yes, everything can. That’s probably why God limited it to one day. And when God gave us 10 commandments, taking time off was just one of them — and not even the first.</p>



<p>We can keep ourselves so busy that we forget what we are doing it for. What we do, we should do out of love. Whether it’s working or taking time to help someone else, cooking, drawing or helping little old ladies across the street, we should do it out of love.</p>



<p>Remember, God loved us so much that He sent His one and only son to die for us so that He could restore a broken relationship between us. Yes, God had to plan ahead. He had to sacrifice something He loved. But He loved us that much.</p>

<p>For Saturday, June 3, 2023: What do we know?</p>



<p>What is it that we know? We probably know a lot of things. But how many of them will affect where we spend eternity?</p>



<p>I know that God is good. Psalm 100:5 (KJV) tells us, “For the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.” And we know that God is love: 1 John 4:7-10.</p>



<p>Do you think of yourself as A Christian? If so, how do we know that you have eternal life? It certainly isn’t through good works that we are saved. If it were, I know that I wouldn’t make it into heaven.</p>



<p>God’s standards are not our own, and he does not measure us by worldly standards. Romans 6:23 (KJV) says that, “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” And, “As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one.”<br>— Romans 3:10 (KJV)</p>



<p>“For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.” — 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 (KJV)</p>



<p>“For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.” — 2 Corinthians 5:21 (KJV)</p>



<p>John 3:16 (KJV) —“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</p>



<p>Romans 10:9-10 (KJV) — “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.”</p>



<p>“For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” — Romans 10:13 (KJV)</p>



<p>Eternity is a long time. And, if we understand the times that we are in, it would be easy to believe that we are nearing a time that God is going to judge the earth and its inhabitants. Personally, I believe that Christ will come and take his church home before then. I can hardly wait.</p>
