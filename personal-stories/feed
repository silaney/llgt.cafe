										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The power went out some time after 7:30 AM. I found out some time around 8 AM. It seems that the rain caused a tree limb to droop down low enough to hit a power line.</p>



<p>It’s an easy fix for the power company. But if I hadn’t seen the power company truck, I would not have known.</p>



<p>What if the power weren’t back on. What would I do if the power outage were more widespread? After a tornado hit neighboring towns a little over 2 years ago, the place where I work lost power for three days.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I have backup lights, and that’s a good place to start. But that’s only a start. I can’t make my instant coffee and, if the power were still out, I wouldn’t want to open my fridge.</p>



<p>So, what is it that I need if the power goes out for an extended time — say, a week or more?</p>



<p>Light<br>Light comes in handy. And, if you have light, it helps to see what you are doing. Along with that is the batteries to power that light.</p>



<p>Water<br>Water may be next, if the water fails to run. LifeStraws are also a good source of clean water. They filter water that is not drinkable and makes it drinkable.</p>



<p>Sheler<br>Assuming that there is no structural damage, as in an earthquake or tornado, some form of protection from the heat or cold may be needed. A battery powered fan may be useful. Extra blankets can also help; sleeping bags work, too.</p>



<p>Food<br>Canned goods may be important. Try to stick with things that you know that you will use, whether in an emergency or not. If you won’t eat it before it expires, you probably shouldn’t buy it.</p>



<p>Planning<br>This includes making plans of what to do if the power goes out. You may check to see if there is still radio. If there is, great. If not, wait. Phone service may or may not work. Check the weather to see if it is raining. You may also check to see if anyone else is without power. If they have power, it’s likely that the problem is in your home or apartment. If you know your neighbors, you may be able to help them with their needs.</p>



<p>Planning can help with a lot of issues in an emergency, such as a power outage. But it can’t solve every issue that might arise. I find that prayer goes a long way, too. In an emergency, teamwork goes much further. It’s a win-win situation.</p>

<p>As God crafted us<br>With His own hands<br>Dirt and clay<br>And likely sands<br>He walked with us<br>And talked with us<br>And our fall hurt Him<br>More than us</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Who am I to write about the heart of God? Who do I think I am? Oh, but it’s not really about me. It’s about God.</p>



<p>You may think of it this way. You are entering an intersection and you see a stop sigh. You may stop at that stop sign, or you may decide simply to slow down. After all, there are other cars approaching the intersection, and simply slowing down seems okay. You don’t say to the stop sign, “What right have you to tell me what to do.” It’s simply a sign.</p>



<p>Say, now, that you are entering another intersection. This time, however, there is a clearly marked, clearly visible police car parked near this intersection. I would venture to guess that you (and I) would be more careful to make sure that we stopped at that stop sigh.</p>



<p>Do I know everything about God? Certainly not. Nor can I know everything about you, partly because I don’t have all the answers regarding my own life. Yet, I walk in a relationship with the living God, not because of anything that I have done, but because of the things that God has done. I, by no means feel worthy to write about the heart of God, but I believe that He has put this on my heart. So, it is by faith that I begin writing. And I am trusting God, though His Spirit, to guide me each step along the way as to what I should and should not write.</p>



<p>No, I’m not a stop sign and this material is not designed to make or even to help you stop doing something. Rather, think of it as one of those signs that point you to the highway that you need to take, the gas station where you need to stop or to the hospital that you need to visit. As with any sign, we all need help getting to the place(s) that we need to go. I believe that God gives us signs — that all of creation is one big sign pointing to Him. I also believe that God gave us His written word, the Bible, to point us to Him. And that is what I will base my writing on.</p>



<p>You may or may not agree with the things that I write. However, like the stop sign, I do not care what you may think of me. But the one in the police car may care what you do.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong. God is not waiting for us to mess up so that He can punish us. The truth is that we all have a problem called sin and death. This sin, because of who we are and who God is, separates us from God. God could have said, “Oh, well, they get what they deserve.” But that is not the heart of God. God would not and could not simply let us perish. He loves us too much to let that happen.</p>



<p>There is much that I will not write about. After many years of study and just plain listing to others, I am certainly ware of many of the different views on everything from creation to eschatology (the study of end times). My goal is not to show you that I am right. My goal is simply to let you know or, perhaps to remind you, that God loves you, whoever you are or however you may see yourself.</p>



<p>John 3: 16 (KJV) tells us, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</p>



<p>Oh, I still have questions. And there have certainly been times when I’ve had doubts — even about the love of God in my life. There have even been times when I felt as if I were on of God’s “Oops — how did that get through?” Trust me, my life is no mistake and neither is yours.</p>



<p>I hope this writing is a blessing: a blessing for both you and for me. By this, I don’t mean that God will give us the riches that we desire in this life but that we will be blessed riches of a relationship with the living God — the only one who can give us eternal life. Don’t break out the hats for the pity-party just yet. God has a plan for each of us, for this life and beyond. God loves you and me; that’s reason to celebrate.</p>

<p>It’s hard to believe all of the changes that have come to Northwest Arkansas since my family moved here in 1965. I, myself, being born in 1966 don’t remember anything of it until the early 70’s. Little that I remember is still the same. Most of the buildings in what used to be the center of town have been replaced, with the exception of “The Old Post Office” and a few shops. And what used to be a shop is now a bank.</p>



<p>I think part of what makes this area so unique is the strong presence of the faith that has been handed down from previous generations. And, while not all churches continue to grow, there are a few that thrive and flourish.</p>



<p>No, Northwest Arkansas doesn’t have the beauty of the Rocky Mountains, and you won’t find the beauty of a California sunrise, but it does have it’s own beauty and charm, along with it’s southern hospitality. And, while some of the major cities along the coast have lost some of their charm, it is not so with what I call home.</p>



<p>While it’s not quite the same as the place I grew up in, Northwest Arkansas still has it’s charms. For the most part, the people are still friendly — still willing to lend a hand. And you don’t have to look long to find a good church home.</p>



<p>No, it’s not California or New York, but I think that’s a good thing. If you move here, I hope you enjoy it. I hope you call this area home. But wherever you find yourself, remember that it’s family that makes a home.</p>

<p>Comparison really isn’t a good thing, unless you are comparing yourself to what you used to be like. And hopefully, you can see an improvement that has taken place over time.</p>



<p>The biggest change in my life happened when I put my faith in Jesus and asked Him into my life. I was just 14 at the time but I knew that I needed God to come into my life to begin making changes. Some things changed right away, while other changes have taken more time.</p>



<p>My most recent job required a lot of changes. I had been in food service for most of my career but found myself in manufacturing. I’ve been in my new job just over two years now and I can look back at all of the lessons that I’ve learned along the way.</p>



<p>I can look at my photography and, thought I thought I was pretty good to begin with, my skill level has come closer to what I thought it was at when I started.</p>



<p>My typing ability has greatly improved since I first began typing, but my hand writing isn’t as good. My skills as an artist have also declined with lack of practice.</p>



<p>We can track some of our progress by keeping a journal or a scrapbook. Some progress is harder to keep track of. And some times it seems that I’m moving backwards when, in reality, it’s probably my target is moving further down the road. It’s pretty common that, as we get better at something, our goal also shifts.</p>



<p>If you’re just starting something, you may want to keep a journal or a scrapbook. If you’re wanting to paint or draw, try to keep your first picture so you can compare it with your most recent work. Hopefully, you can see an improvement. And try to avoid comparing yourself with others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Let me tell you the story of a young man. You may know him. After becoming a Christian, he left his church because he was afraid that he might be called on to pray.</p>



<p>Speaking in front of others: out of the question.<br>Rating the Bible to others: a total embarrassment.</p>



<p>It took all of the courage he had to approach the photo editor at the local newspaper to submit a photo for publication, after which he would receive a check in the mail for $5.</p>



<p>All too often, this young boy was told that being a photographer is too hard. Thought his adolescence, he was told that his work just wasn’t good enough. Even after his work began to improve, he still had trouble seeing it in himself. This failure to see his present reality led him to give up time after time with little or no effort.</p>



<p>This young boy — someone who could have easily passed for someone at least 5 years younger — was so shy. The product of a broken home and a broken educational system, he couldn’t even pray out loud to ask Jesus into his heart. Yet, he knew, somehow, that God heard him.</p>



<p>All this young boy wanted was to take pictures. And, in spite of overhang, he would walk 20 minutes to the athletic department at the local university. It was a path that he had walked often, and he could remember, not only the beer cans that litter the fraternity lawns, but the old school building that piqued his curiosity. You may not know this, but this young boy waited up to an hour for a chance to get a press pass to photograph various sporting events. You may not know that this young boy had a nervous tick in his feet that caused him to rub his toes together until they became raw.</p>



<p>You may not know the impact that you have on a young man — until we reach Heaven and God — Jesus — comes to you and says, “Well done, good and faithful servant.” You see, some live their whole our lives, waiting for Jesus to tell them these words, while many will only hear, “Depart from me, I never knew you.”</p>



<p>I want to be the one whom Jesus meets with a proud smile, gives me a huge hug, and tells me He loves me. I want to be the young man who grew up to be brave and always looking for the bright side: the reason to give praise. I want to be the one who is always looking for ways to help others — the ones who really need it. Like me.</p>



<p>You see, God rally does pay attention, and it is the little things that he sees.</p>



<p>If there is something that you want to do, go for it. You will probably make mistakes along the way, but that’s how we learn. You may just find that the path your are on is not the one that you want to stay on, but that is part of learning, too. The main thing is that you don’t give up — on yourself or on others. Keep going, and you will find where you are meant to go.</p>

<p>Who am I? It’s one of those deeper questions that we ask ourselves from time to time. And we may get a different answer each time.<br>I’m not entirely sure who I am. In short, I’m Ralph. I know who I’m not. I’m not the things I own, the people I know or the things that I have done. These things may help shape me, but they don’t make me who I am. Another thing I am not: I am not what I was and I am not yet who I will be.</p>



<p>I was 14 when I asked Jesus to be lord of my life, which was 43 years ago. After hearing the Gospel, I realized that I was a sinner and that God had sent His Son to die on a cross so that I might have eternal life.</p>



<p>Because I was so shy at the time, I couldn’t pray out loud. That has certainly changed. I’m no longer shy about praying out loud and some times as others if I can pray with and for them.</p>



<p>Anyone can become a follower of Jesus. We don’t have to live a particular lifestyle. We just need to have faith that Jesus can save us from our sins. Really, He is the only one who can. I cannot save myself from my sins. I put my faith in Jesus and God gave me eternal life. He also gave me the Holy Spirit to help guild me. If you like, you could say I’m born again.</p>



<p>What else is true? I am loved. I am fearfully and wonderfully made. I am a child of the living God. How about you? John 3:16 (KJV) says that, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” Are you a whosoever? I’m a whosoever.</p>

<p>The things that I do today, the things that I do every day, especially the things that I do first thing in the morning are key to determining my future. What I do really does matter. Today, I plant the seeds that I will reap in the tomorrows to come. So, what is it that I do, or at least try to do first thing in the morning?</p>



<p>First, I read a bible verse. Psalm 143: 8 (KJV) says, “Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.”</p>



<p>I drink water, or lemon water, which helps refresh the bodies fluids.</p>



<p>I take vitamin D or a multi vitamin which can help mood in addition to having other health benefits.</p>



<p>I also listen to music. Right now, I’m listening to Audrey Assad. It’s calming and helps me to remember what really matters — a relationship with the living God.</p>



<p>Finally, I remember what I am thankful for: past, present and things to come.</p>



<p>This is what I do first thing. I also write, go for a walk and often take pictures. What is it that you could do first thing in the morning to help you get off to a good start? If you like, you can comment below.</p>

<p>I was reading that a local pastor had decided to back a local semi-pro team until he discovered that they were going to sell beer at the events. It must have been a touch decision. But the pastor stuck by his decision and that is commendable.</p>



<p>It can be hard to stick by our decisions, especially if someone we care about is trying to get us to change our mind. I remember someone trying to get me to smoke for the first time. It wasn’t a hard decision to choose not to smoke, but what if it had been a close friend. The choice would have been much harder.</p>



<p>Look at Samson and the choice that he had with Delilah. That must have been tough. In fact, Samson compared Delilah and her nagging to a constant dripping.</p>



<p>The problem is that, if we give in in are of our lives, it can be easier to compromise in other areas. One thing can lead to another and another. Before we know it we are doing things that we never intended to do.</p>



<p>It’s best if we can to know our boundaries and stop there. If we can, we may need to move our boundaries to in so that we are better equipped to avoid the things that we should. And, if you can, let others know where your boundaries stand. It will help you and it will help them know how to relate better to you.</p>
