<p>The things that I do today, the things that I do every day, especially the things that I do first thing in the morning are key to determining my future. What I do really does matter. Today, I plant the seeds that I will reap in the tomorrows to come. So, what is it that I do, or at least try to do first thing in the morning?</p>



<p>First, I read a bible verse. Psalm 143: 8 (KJV) says, “Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.”</p>



<p>I drink water, or lemon water, which helps refresh the bodies fluids.</p>



<p>I take vitamin D or a multi vitamin which can help mood in addition to having other health benefits.</p>



<p>I also listen to music. Right now, I’m listening to Audrey Assad. It’s calming and helps me to remember what really matters — a relationship with the living God.</p>



<p>Finally, I remember what I am thankful for: past, present and things to come.</p>



<p>This is what I do first thing. I also write, go for a walk and often take pictures. What is it that you could do first thing in the morning to help you get off to a good start? If you like, you can comment below.</p>

<p>How much is enough? It’s a simple question, right? Last night, I got about four hours sleep. I got to bed late and woke up early. For a few, this might be enough sleep. For me, it’s not. Fortunately, I did get a little more sleep after going to an appointment that I had, but it still doesn’t seem like enough.</p>



<p>But there are less needed things that make it harder to know when enough is enough. For example, I got another lens for my camera last week. It wasn’t all that expensive compared to most of the lenses that Canon sells and it fills a “need” that my other lenses don’t. But it’s not a need, it’s a want.</p>



<p>Similarly, there is a mixer on display at Sam’s Club that looks so nice. But it’s not a need or a want, at least not now. And I don’t have room for it in my kitchen. Really the list of things could go on.</p>



<p>Conversely, there are things that I have in my life from time to time that I would rather not have: frustration, irritation and loneliness, just to name a few. These are just some of the things that I would rather not deal with.</p>



<p>Did you know that, according to the Bible, it’s the latter things — the loneliness and frustrations — that draw us closer to or make us more like God? I know it, but it’s easy to forget, especially when we’re “suffering” these things.</p>



<p>So, what are we to do? For the first, it’s best to have a budget. It needs to be one that we can stick with, and it should be as close to our actual needs as possible. I say this because things like groceries can be hard to predict, unless we really work hard at planning both the budget and our diet.</p>



<p>For the other things, we can learn to deal with them. Breathing exercises — taking a long breath in through the nose, holding it for a few seconds and a long breath out the mouth can help. Just counting slowly to ten can also help.</p>



<p>You see, most of our life depends on how we see it. If we see getting a parking ticket as a bad thing, it becomes a bad thing. But if we are able to see it as building patients, it can become a positive thing; that is, if we want to be more patient. For now, I think there might be enough time for another nap.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&#8220;Jesus loves me, this I know.  Just that sometimes, I have to go real slow.&#8221;</p>



<p>The trend has long been to do more, faster and better than before. I think we all feel the pressure in some way to get more done. Yet, even God took a day off.</p>



<p>There are at least a few ways to take a step back from our work. We just have to figure out what works best for us.</p>



<p>Plan ahead to do nothing. It could mean that you plan to set aside a few minutes each day, or it could mean that you plan to take a full day off each week. It also means figuring out what you may need to do or to put off in order to take this time.</p>



<p>By doing nothing, I don’t mean that you have to lie in bed and not move. What I’m talking about may look like one of the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Take a nap.</li>



<li>Call a friend.</li>



<li>Journal.</li>



<li>Pray or pick up a Bible.</li>



<li>Draw, crochet, cook or something else.</li>



<li>Take a leisurely walk.</li>
</ul>



<p>These are just a few ideas. The thing is that some of us — myself included — have to plan things or else they just don’t happen. And, for me, even putting something on a to-do list dues’t guarantee that it will get done.</p>



<p>The thing is to do something that you will enjoy doing. And keep it simple. Don’t think, as I some times do, my neighbor’s lawn needs cleaning, so I’m going to take care of that. Yes, there is a time for these things, but it cannot replace taking at least a little time to replenish ourselves.</p>



<p>Can taking time off be taken to extremes? Yes, everything can. That’s probably why God limited it to one day. And when God gave us 10 commandments, taking time off was just one of them — and not even the first.</p>



<p>We can keep ourselves so busy that we forget what we are doing it for. What we do, we should do out of love. Whether it’s working or taking time to help someone else, cooking, drawing or helping little old ladies across the street, we should do it out of love.</p>



<p>Remember, God loved us so much that He sent His one and only son to die for us so that He could restore a broken relationship between us. Yes, God had to plan ahead. He had to sacrifice something He loved. But He loved us that much.</p>

<p>Is there something that you wanted to learn but just haven’t been able to do? For a time, I wanted to learn how to knit. Or was it crochet? I get the two mixed up. I tried for a while, but couldn’t get past the first row.</p>



<p>Some times, what we need is a little more practice. It can take time to develop muscle memory, and some things may come easier than others. I hated my typing class. Someone told me, years ago, that he used typing nearly every day. Now, I’m using typing every day.</p>



<p>Other times, we just need the right teacher to come along. I loved art class in elementary school, but I didn’t do very well until I got a teacher that knew what she was doing. Trust me, a good teacher can make all of the difference.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, unless our job requires it, we tend to give up on the creative part of us after graduating from school. We probably all use our creative side in one way or another, though, it’s likely that we reserve it for problem solving.</p>



<p>I’ve been taking pictures for over 40 years and it is unlikely that I will ever stop, though my picture taking does slow down at times. These days, I’m doing more writing than I am taking pictures. It wasn’t something that I planned. It just happened that way.</p>



<p>It’s been a while since I’ve had any writing classes. I have listened to a few audio books on the subject. Mostly, I just wrote. This is mostly how I learned photography, and how I learned how to use a computer. I just did it, learning from my mistakes and going on.</p>



<p>It helps to have a teacher, especially if you want to get really good at something. You can find teachers online or in person, in books, magazines and on video. The advantage to having a real person teaching you is that you can get feedback on your work. But you may also learn by just jumping in and doing whatever it is that you want to learn.</p>



<p>If you want to learn photography, I know of no better way than to just go out and start taking pictures. I started out with a camera, shooting film. These days, I take most of my pictures with my phone.</p>



<p>Study composition and look closely at the work of other photographers to see what they might be doing. Try different angles and different lighting. Different filters can also be a big help when it comes to getting better pictures.</p>



<p>If you want to learn how to draw, get some books on the subject. Don’t worry if your first picture is a stick figure or doesn’t look as good as you might want. Don’t compare yourself with others, but compare this year’s work with last years. If you continue to practice, you will get better.</p>

<p>If you don’t know who Peppa Pig is, ask a five year old. Peppa Pig is a children’s show that starts out with a little pig named Peppa Pig introducing herself and the rest of her family. Her best friend is a rabbit and. It’s a British show that I think can teach us all a few things.</p>



<p><strong>Be respectful</strong><br>Along with trust, respect is among the most important parts of any relationship. It is something that we should show others right away instead of, as some think, that it has to be earned before it can be given.</p>



<p>In order to give respect, however, we have to know what respect is and what is not. And we must first have respect for ourselves. We show respect by understanding that our value comes from our creator. It does not mean giving in to what others want, whatever the cost. It requires trust and honesty and caring for the good of ourselves and of others. To show respect for ourselves and others, we must know when to say “yes” and “no.”</p>



<p><strong>Ask questions</strong><br>Along the same lines as respect, we ought to be able to ask questions. Avoid questions like “Why are you so fat,” and “How could you be such an idiot”. “What do you mean,” and “How did you come to that conclusion” might be better questions. The thing that we want to do is to clarify, to learn more while avoiding making assumptions.</p>



<p><strong>Make up quickly</strong><br>Friends or family may hurt us and sometimes do. Yet, it is almost never done with the intention of causing physical or emotional harm. Avoid cutting off communication. Instead, try to be the first to open up. Talk about your feelings and avoid calling the other person names or attacking someone personally. Just because that person hurt you in some way doesn’t give you permission to hurt them in in return. Your goal is to restore the relationship, not to get even.</p>



<p><strong>Look for ways to help others</strong><br>We all need help at one time or another. Social distancing and pride may make it harder to discover ways that we can help each other, but it’s not impossible. We may be able to find a place where we can volunteer or we may just keep our eyes open to be able to spot some place where we can help.</p>



<p><strong>Have fun</strong><br>Finally, have fun. Find things that you like doing together, even if it’s jumping in muddy puddles. You can always find things that you like doing alone, but try to find things that you enjoy doing with others. And remember “When you jump in muddy puddles, you have to wear your boots.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>James 1: 5-6 (KJV) tells us that, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.”<br>Often, we lack faith because we aren’t really sure what we believe. Any time we start anything new, it takes time to learn what we need to know. Hopefully, we can learn the fundaments early, but that may take years. Studies like law and medicine, and even culinary arts can take years to master and, still, one can never learn everything that there is to learn. Odd thing is that there are a wide variety of opinions in any field of study. And religion is no exception.<br>If we aren’t sure what we believe, it’s easy to be swayed by the latest thing that we’ve heard. It is important, therefore, to be careful who we are listening to. At the same time, it can be good to seek out different opinions, even if we think that we’ve already heard it all.</p>



<p>Current social media is often set up to flood us with one view, while sometimes blocking other options, whether by our choice or by the choice of an algorithm, or both.<br>Not knowing affects other areas of our lives, too. Studies have shown that, the earlier people know their life’s path, the more successful they will be in reaching their goals. Not knowing what we want to do can cause us to waste not only money, but years of our lives. Yet, even if we missed getting an early start, it’s never too late to decide what we want to do with our lives.<br>There are a few things that can help us determine what we might do next. We cannot say that what we do next will determine the rest of our lives, for too much is outside our control. But we can decide what direction we would like to take.<br>The first thing that we can do is to write down some goals. If you don’t know where you want to go, it becomes easy to live life in a rut, where it may seem like we aren’t getting anywhere. Yet, even these times can teach us something. I like to use a computer to type out my goals.<br>Be specific. Instead of writing that you want make a lot of money and retire early, determine how much money that you need to retire, when you would like to retire, a date you will start saving and a clear plan on how much you will need to save or invest each year between now and retirement. Also, have a clear idea of what you want retirement to look like. Do you want to live on a beach or a mansion?<br>Be realistic. It’s okay to dream big. One of my favorite books was Ann Kiemel’s book, “I Love the Word Impossible,” where she talks about dreaming things that only God can do. But I do not want and will never play pro football in the NFL, and I will never become a sky diver. No thank you. But there are lots of things that I can decide that I want to do and, though I may never perfect any particular skill, I can get better at just about anything I work at.<br>Another thing we can do is to talk to friends — those that know us best. Find out what they think that we are or might be good at. Years ago, someone told me that I should have been a librarian because of my many interests. Today, I use that in my blog.<br>Finally, start small. Intentionally, figure out what the least you can do is and do that. If you want to run a marathon, start with a five or ten minute walk. Don’t try, on day one, to run 5 or 6 miles because you are much more likely to give up. Do this with any new habit that you want to incorporate into your routine. I made a list of things that I want to do each day on a dry erase board and I check them off as I do them. My list has 16 things to do and I don’t put things that I’m already in the habit of doing. This can also help limit the time that we spend checking emails, taking phone calls and checking social media.<br>Being free to do whatever can be nice, but having and reaching goals can give us a sense of purpose. It can also help keep us from waking up and realizing that we’ve “wasted” our time on this Earth. Knowing what we believe also helps us when we pray. And if you need wisdom, ask God.</p>
