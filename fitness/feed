<p>I went to the gym last night but didn’t stay long. I had gone the night before but don’t plan to go tonight. I know that rest is an important part of fitness. I just don’t fully understand how exercise, rest and diet work together.</p>



<p>The gym that I go to has an app that helps with diet. I just haven’t explored it yet. Also, they offer something for $10 dollars that helps me to know some things about myself, like bone density and body fat. I’m not sure all that it does, but I’m interested in knowing more.</p>



<p>I do know a little about diet. And I have learned a little about overall fitness. What works for someone else, however, may not work for me. And the thing that works for me may not work for you. That’s why it’s important to get the advise of a professional.</p>



<p>It’s also good to have a goal. Not only can a goal give us clear direction, but it can help us to continue when motivation seems low.</p>

<p>I joined a local gym a couple of weeks ago. The place where I work compensates part of the monthly membership fee. If you are interested in joining a gym, perhaps the place you work does the same.</p>



<p>Working out has been interesting. Usually, I go after work and stay for between 20 and 30 minutes, between three and five days a week. If I wake up early enough, I can go for a short walk but, right now, the weather is just too hot to be outdoors.</p>



<p>Mostly, I’m trying to work on my upper body strength, though I do work some on my leg strength. I start off with chin-ups, which I’m able to get three or four. I usually finish with some time on a treadmill.</p>



<p>One thing I realized right away is that it’s going to take time. Like anything that’s worth while, it takes commitment to keep working at it. It’s not one of those things that I can do a few times and see real results. Nor is it something that I can say, “well nothing has changes, so I’m just going to quit.” Real change takes time — apparently it takes a lot of time.</p>



<p>Real health takes time. But it’s a daily thing. It takes more than half an hour at a gym, four days a week. Tomorrow’s health is based on all of the seemingly small decisions that I’ve made over the past few years. It’s the walks and the diet and the emotional health, along with other things that help determine my health tomorrow.</p>

<p>Dear Diary,<br>The teaching at church was from Matthew 7. It was on how we should approach God in prayer: with boldness and with confidence. We can approach God with boldness because of what Jesus has done on our behalf and we can approach God with confidence because of who God is.</p>



<p>I managed to go for a walk this morning. Now, it’s too hot and I don’t really want to go anywhere. I just got back from church and had baby bok choy. I’m supposed to meet Colin for burgers for dinner.</p>



<p>I made it to the gym a few days last week. One day I had intended to go, I wound up coming home to unplug something that I had intended to unplug before leaving for work. Oops.</p>



<p>The Olympics are in full swing. I’m not sure who might have one something. It seems that there is a lot of hype when it comes to local businesses that doesn’t come to fruition.</p>



<p>Yesterday, I had baked salmon and cauliflower with sliced lemon on top. I seared both with avocado oil and butter on medium heat before putting them both — in a cast iron skillet — in to an oven, preheated to 35o degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes. It was so good, I could hardly wait for it to cool down before starting to eat it.</p>



<p>God, I pray that You would enter the hearts of man that the world could find the only source of peace, which is Your Son: Jesus Christ. Thank You for loving me. Thank You for Your Word, the Bible. Thank You for my friend, Lily.</p>



<p>In Jesus’ name,<br>Amen</p>

<p>If you want to loose weight, changing your environment might help. You may not be able to remove that pizza parlor from your neighborhood, or find a way to avoid passing by the donut shop on the way to work, but there are some things that you can do at home to make loosing weight easier.</p>



<p>First, get rid of the high calorie snack foods, like cookies, sodas and even chips. I don’t mean that you should go on a binge. If you can’t give them away, maybe it would be a good idea to throw them out.</p>



<p>Next, you look for ready to eat foods that you can eat. You may find vegetable trays in your deli or produce department, or prepared fruit salads. Try to avoid the pre-made dressings. Things like plain yogurt might be a good option.</p>



<p>Plan ahead. If you have something in the fridge or on the countertop ready to go, you are less likely to look for less healthy options. Also, if you take something when you travel, you are less likely to stop for fast food.</p>



<p>Finally, try loading your refrigerator with healthier snacks. It may take some work to slice up some carrots, cut up some apples, or cook some brown rice. You can also search the internet for more ideas. You just may find that the extra effort is well worth it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Feeling stuck. Not sure how to get out of the daily grind? Maybe you just want to try something different but aren’t sure where to start. Here are some ideas that may help.</p>



<p>Start small. Take a moment to write down a list of things that you would like to start doing: exercising, eating more vegetables, remembering to feed your dog, for example. Find a place to put this list where you can see this list each morning and throughout the day. I have mine on a dry eras board. If you want to walk each day, start out with a two to ten minute walk. On weekends, I may walk three hours or more, but I try to walk a little each day, even if it’s to the fridge.</p>



<p>Try joining a church, a church small group for larger churches, or a club. Volunteer for a local charity or for the library. There are so many organizations that can use volunteer help.</p>



<p>Seek a new job/career or get a second job. You may have to do this if you loose your current job for whatever reason. Hopefully, this doesn’t happen, but it happens all the time. It can seem like a good thing, but often, it does’t. Either way, put your energy into finding something new and, if possible, exciting.</p>



<p>Take up a hobby. There are so many to choose from. Just within art there is photography, watercolor, pastel, color pencil, charcoal, those little fluffy things and so much more. You may even want to take a class that can help you learn a craft and may help you meet others who are also interested in art.</p>



<p>Teach a class. I found a local store, Natural Grocers, that allows me to use their kitchen to teach a class. They also provide me with up to $100 groceries to use as a demo. They do have rules that I am required to follow but nothing too difficult. I’ve only done one class but another is scheduled for next month. Just make sure that, if you decide to teach your class that you know your subject. Curiosity helps, too.</p>



<p>Find others to go for walks with. There may be a local photography club, too, as well as writers and speakers clubs. You should be able to do a Google search for local clubs.</p>



<p>The greatest/best change in my life came when I put my faith in Jesus to pay my sin debt and restore a relationship with God. John 3:16 (KJV) tells us that, <strong>“ For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</strong> It gives us what we cannot earn and what none of us deserve: forgiveness, wholeness and eternal life. Some things, we get as soon as we accept God’s gift, while other things take a lifetime to change. A prayer of salvation is just the beginning.</p>



<p>Change can be hard at times, especially if it is forced on us. But it doesn’t have to be. It’s our decision as to whether we see change as a good or bad thing. Try to see it as a good thing. In one way, change will occur, with or without us.</p>



<p>Note: I’m not talking about some changes that others may try to force upon us. Even a lie can seem true if you hear it often enough. Keep an open mind to differing views and you should be able to decide what to think about differing issues on your own. Is there a write and wrong? In some cases, yes, but in others, no. You are the one who decides which is which, at least in your own mind. And this, too, may change over time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Physical goals often top one’s list of New Year’s resolutions. And when it comes to our health and the goals that we set, there are a number of options to choose from.</p>



<p>Now, I’m not going to say that we are going to start exercising because it is something that we will enjoy doing, though there are those who truly enjoy a morning run. Personally, I prefer a more leisurely walk, with plenty of time to stop and take pictures along the way. But running and walking are not the only options to choose from.</p>



<p>First, we can choose from a goal based on a certain physical activity, a change in our diet, or one targeted at a possible result of either. For example, we could set a goal ride a bicycle at least 10 miles a week. We could decide we are going to walk or swim at least three times a week. We could decide that we will lift weights five days a week. We could also decide that we want to loose 10 pounds in the next year.</p>



<p>In setting our goals, we may need to meet with a health professional, or find a weight trainer, depending on our own unique needs. We may join a gym, or find a group of people whom we can meet with, who will join us in whatever we choose to do, and encourage us along the way. It may take some planning to get us to where we can do the thing that we set to do. In other words, we may not be able to decide that on the first day of the year, we are going to throw on our running shoes and start running and that, in doing so, we will still be running on a regular basis at the end of the year.</p>



<p>Physical goals should still meet the SMART goal setting method, meaning they should be<br>specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timed. Yet, it is likely that we will also need outside help with this goal — either a professional of some sort, or just one or more people who can encourage us along the way — helping us to keep going when we want to quit.</p>



<p>We will also need a strong enough “Why” when it comes to any goal of this sort, whether it be to exercise more, loose weight, or try a new diet. Because changes in these areas often don’t come easily, and we naturally resist such changes, we need to know why we are attempting to make these changes. It should be a reason that we believe strongly in, and it should be for us, and not for someone else.</p>



<p>One final consideration is that, if we are setting our goal based on a result that we hope to see, it could take time to reach that goal. Therefore, it may help to break larger goals into smaller goal. For example, instead of setting a goal to loose 10 pound over the next year, we may decide that we will aim at loosing one pound a month.</p>



<p>And whichever goal we set, it’s a good idea to find some way to reward ourselves along the way, as long as it doesn’t go against our goal. Occasionally rewards can help encourage us, and help keep us going month after month.</p>
