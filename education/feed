<p>Is there something that you wanted to learn but just haven’t been able to do? For a time, I wanted to learn how to knit. Or was it crochet? I get the two mixed up. I tried for a while, but couldn’t get past the first row.</p>



<p>Some times, what we need is a little more practice. It can take time to develop muscle memory, and some things may come easier than others. I hated my typing class. Someone told me, years ago, that he used typing nearly every day. Now, I’m using typing every day.</p>



<p>Other times, we just need the right teacher to come along. I loved art class in elementary school, but I didn’t do very well until I got a teacher that knew what she was doing. Trust me, a good teacher can make all of the difference.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, unless our job requires it, we tend to give up on the creative part of us after graduating from school. We probably all use our creative side in one way or another, though, it’s likely that we reserve it for problem solving.</p>



<p>I’ve been taking pictures for over 40 years and it is unlikely that I will ever stop, though my picture taking does slow down at times. These days, I’m doing more writing than I am taking pictures. It wasn’t something that I planned. It just happened that way.</p>



<p>It’s been a while since I’ve had any writing classes. I have listened to a few audio books on the subject. Mostly, I just wrote. This is mostly how I learned photography, and how I learned how to use a computer. I just did it, learning from my mistakes and going on.</p>



<p>It helps to have a teacher, especially if you want to get really good at something. You can find teachers online or in person, in books, magazines and on video. The advantage to having a real person teaching you is that you can get feedback on your work. But you may also learn by just jumping in and doing whatever it is that you want to learn.</p>



<p>If you want to learn photography, I know of no better way than to just go out and start taking pictures. I started out with a camera, shooting film. These days, I take most of my pictures with my phone.</p>



<p>Study composition and look closely at the work of other photographers to see what they might be doing. Try different angles and different lighting. Different filters can also be a big help when it comes to getting better pictures.</p>



<p>If you want to learn how to draw, get some books on the subject. Don’t worry if your first picture is a stick figure or doesn’t look as good as you might want. Don’t compare yourself with others, but compare this year’s work with last years. If you continue to practice, you will get better.</p>

<p>Interested in learning something new? There so many tools that can help speed you along the way. Not only are there the traditional tools, but there are a number of electronic tools that can help you learn and memorize new information. Here are some you can use.</p>



<p>Apps<br>Apps for your phone can be downloaded from your favorite app store and can be easily used. While some are free, they may require some kind of registration. Others, which offer different classes, usually have some sort of cost. Remember, however, that apps like YouTube and iTunes U offer a great deal of free content.</p>



<p>Audio Books<br>One of my favorite way to learn is just to listen to audio books. Subjects include business, health and wellness, history, science and technology, just to name a few. If you have a daily commute or are able to listen to audio books at work, this can be an excellent option.</p>



<p>Chalkboard or dry eraser board<br>One way of memorizing long sentences or phrases is to write it out and read it out loud. Each time you read it, erase one or more words and see if you can remember what the missing words are.</p>



<p>Doodles<br>According to teachwell.com, “Doodling can actually help you focus and make it easier to listen. It can relieve stress and improve productivity. It can also help in memory retention; doodle a number or word or image that pertains to what’s being addressed and it’s more likely to stay with you. And there’s no such thing as a mistake; they are your doodles, and whatever you create is just right.” They do warn, however, that doodling can be a distraction to the one who is speaking or teaching.</p>



<p>Flow charts<br>Unlike traditional note taking, some people prefer to organize their notes into flow charts, bubbles of information, usually connected by lines. You can use notebooks or apps that are designed for putting together flow charts.</p>



<p>Index cards<br>I find that index cards work very well for memorizing large amounts of information. I can have a stack of 100 or more information. Easier cards can be removed from the stack in order to work on information that is harder to memorize. You can, for example, put a word on one side and it’s definition on the other. Index cards can also be shuffled and flipped.</p>



<p>Remember, the mind is the one tool that stays sharper with use. To put something into long term memory, it has to be studied or done repeatedly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Learning begins with questions. I remember asking a lot of questions when I was little. It’s pretty common. I don’t remember asking why the sky was blue, but I do remember asking how long it took for light from the sun to reach the earth. I was a little older at the time. Older than when I was pointing and asking “what’s that?”</p>



<p>Everything that we know, or at least those things that we think we know, began with a question. When we are little, we all ask lots of questions, including wondering why the sky is blue. And we try to find answers. We may not always get the right answer, but when we are young, we tend to believe what we are told.</p>



<p>The important thing is that we ask questions, and we need to ask the right questions. Don’t ask “why am I so stupid,” or “why do I make so many mistakes.” Instead, ask “what can I learn from my mistakes?” We all make mistakes. Thomas Edison, when inventing the light bulb didn’t see a thousand failures but a thousand experiments that pointed out elements that didn’t work.</p>



<p>They say that necessity is the mother of invention. Something goes wrong or we need to do something faster. Maybe we just need to do something a little differently. There are lots of questions we could ask: “what if…., how would making this change affect that?, or what if I just started all over?”</p>



<p>“Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.” — Albert Einstein</p>



<p>It takes quite an imagination to ask questions. That’s why children ask so many questions because the are so curious about everything and everything is still so new. It’s amazing, however, how quickly things become mundane. We stop exploring and we stop asking questions.</p>



<p>None of us know everything, but I think that we often think that we know enough. And it has become so easy to find answers to the questions that we seek though a book or video. In fact, we can find just about any answer that we want on the small computer in our pocket. But that doesn’t mean that we should stop asking questions.</p>



<p>There is one more thing. If we ask someone else a question, we need to listen, even if that person’s option differs from our own. Listing without judging and only ask questions to clarify. Avoid building your own argument when the other person is talking. Other people can often see things that we cannot see and they have a perspective that is different from ours. And the strangest part of all is that they may be right, too, or they may be right and we may be wrong. Be open to asking questions. It’s okay if we don’t find the answer right away.</p>

<p>Is there something keeping you from learning? Perhaps you think you’re not smart enough. Or maybe you think that you’re too old to try something new. Maybe you just don’t know what you might be interested in or what you might like to learn next.</p>



<p>Note that I didn’t mention that you may not know what you might be good at. There are very few things that any of us are good at the very first time we try and, for the majority of us, it takes a lot of practice before anyone outside of our own immediate family will tell us we’re good at something.</p>



<p>I have, for example, worked on my writing for years — mostly in private journals and such. Likewise, I spent years refining my cooking skills. And as far as my photography, it has taken me most of my lifetime to get close to as good as I thought I was when I first picked up a camera. There will always be the critic that will let us know that we aren’t as good at somethings as we think we are. Yet, there are few who will let us know that we can and will get better at whatever we work at.</p>



<p>Not smart enough? Says who? Albert Einstein was not the top student in his early years. Walt Disney failed at least twice before opening Disney. And Steve Jobs was fired from his job at Apple. You may have to adapt your method of learning in order to study a subject, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that you can’t learn.</p>



<p>I’ll never make it on to a professional football/baseball/hockey team, but that doesn’t mean that I cannot throw a ball. The problem isn’t that we’re not good enough. More likely than not, as we get older, we began to compare our work to the work of others, and if our work doesn’t measure up to the work of others, we may get discouraged and give up. Yet, we often fail to take into consideration the time and effort that someone else may have put into doing something, like bounding a ball and putting it though a hoop.</p>



<p>Too old? There are far too many stories — told and untold — of those who began something new or finished something that they started long before, even in their latter years. Likely, however, there are just as many stories of those who gave up while they were still in their youth. Yet, I believe that we are never too old to learn something new.</p>



<p>Maybe you just don’t know where to start. You can look at what you are already doing and go from there. You may also do some research to find out what is being taught in your area or find someone who is willing to teach you what he or she already knows. And, just as we are not as good as we could be at something when we first start, we may not know how enjoyable something might be until we have done it for a while. I, for example, hated typing class. I wasn’t any good at it, and my teacher and I couldn’t seem to see eye to eye. Now, I do much more typing than I do writing by hand. And I kind of enjoy it. It’s the same with the work I now do. I hated some of the lines that I worked on — until I began to get better at it.</p>



<p>Can we do everything? Certainly not. But I believe that most of us can do far more than we ever imagined. At least that’s what experience has taught me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I wish that an education could make all of our lives better. I wish it were that easy, but it’s not.<br>Growing in our knowledge base does have several benefits.</p>



<p>One benefit is that being smart, or at least feeling smart can help us feel better about ourselves. No doubt there are going to be people or tests who are more than willing to tell us what we don’t know or what we’re not good at. We don’t have to listen to them, but it is nice to feel that we are good at something.</p>



<p>Knowing how to do something may also give us an advantage in our marketplace. Simply putting our experience into a resume may help a person start out at a higher wage and, over time, that money can add up.</p>



<p>While learning about one subject may help us excel in one area, knowing more about different areas can help us converse with different people. Having an overall curiosity can do pretty much the same thing.</p>



<p>I think it’s important that we stay curious, that we never loose the urge to learn. Stop learning and you start dying. Yet it seems to me that people, younger and younger are form their opinions with a “no one’s going to change my opinion” mentality.</p>



<p>I think that continuing to learn helps keep our minds younger, too. Yes, it depends, in large part on the things that we take into out bodies and the other things that we do. Our body acts like a machine; fail to take care of it, damage it in some way and it won’t work the way that is supposed to. On the other hand, if we take care of ourselves, if we feed both our bodies and our minds properly, we’re likely to be better off in the long run.</p>



<p>I say better off, but we will not necessarily be better people. The saying that a little knowledge can be dangerous may just be true. But it depends on our character and on our decisions. Give two people $1,000 and one may turn it into a $100 thousand, while the other may loose $99 at the casino. Our character and personal drive have more power to take us places than any amount of knowledge.</p>



<p>There are also a couple of problems with knowledge. One is that knowledge without drive or direction won’t take us anywhere. It’s like having a Ford Mustang that we keep in neutral, while knowledge without character may take us down the wrong road. Knowledge is simply a tool. It can be a good thing in the right hands, or it could be misused in the wrong hands.</p>



<p>I’ve been around long enough to see that some people seem to feel that their education makes them better than others. Indeed, more education can help, but it does not make one group better than another. Our value ought to come from our creator, and we ought to use whatever we have to help others. It can be a tough lesson to learn but there is nothing that we have that we have not been given by God. It should make us more humble rather than more proud. And it should be this perspective that helps us shape our view of ourselves as well as those around us.</p>



<p>Another problem, if you want to see it this way, is that the things that we “know” is constantly changing. The things that we thought were true just a few years ago may have been revised or even proven wrong. Or there may be a better way to do something that we’ve been doing all of our lives.</p>



<p>At the same time, there is so much information that it’s impossible to keep up. I heard a story about a woman who entered her chosen career field and, because she failed to keep learning, those who entered the same career filed just a few years later were way ahead of her and she felt like there was no way to keep up.</p>



<p>Also, you may have heard the saying, “You can’t take it with you (when you die).” I have a hard time believing that we forget everything when we die. Perhaps, it’s just that there won’t be a use for many of the things that we’ve learned in this life. There won’t be cars that break down and need to be fixed, there won’t be computers that need to be programmed, and their aren’t likely to be a need for lawyers to defend us.</p>



<p>If you want to work on something, work on your character. Work at being a better person, loving others rather than judging them. Choose to look for similarities rather than differences, and ways to encourage rather than discourage. At the same time, never give up your curiosity. And never stop learning.</p>

<p>Learning vs. Creativity</p>



<p>A week or so ago, I was walking through one of the parks between the lake and the library, and saw a family — a mother and a child, who was playing in the children’s area. The question came to mind, does education kill creativity. Kill: that’s probably too strong a word. But does it hinder creativity?</p>



<p>The church that I go to also serves as a school during the week The sign out front says “play based learning.” Play encourages creativity and teaches relational skills. I’m not saying that they don’t teach math or other classes; it’s likely that they do, but maybe they find a way to make it more like play. Learning should be fun, otherwise, when we no longer have to learn, we are likely to stop.</p>



<p>I wish that I could say that I enjoyed my years in public school. These years were hard, and I was glad when they were over.</p>



<p>A formal education is a foundation, however, for an ongoing learning process that can last a lifetime. Learning is just the beginning. Taking the things that we learn and being able to apply it to our lives to not only make our own lives better, but to better the lives of others, that is wisdom.</p>



<p>When I was in Jr. hight and high school, and even into college, I was able to take classes that helped me work on my creativity. One of my favorite classes was a college class on creative writing. I remember making three or more attempts at just my first paper before coming up with something that I was happy with.</p>



<p>Photography is another area where I enjoy being creative. Cooking too. Creativity requires time, though, and if we are not setting aside to be creative, then it is not likely a skill that we will build.</p>



<p>What can keep us from building this skill? Spending all of our time on learning other things, work, recreational activities like watching television, or just trying to live life. Nothing is wrong with an of these activities, in moderation.</p>



<p>Of course, we can go our whole lives without being creative, yet, our creativity can be one of the best things that we can offer to this world, and I believe that if is one of the greatest gifts that we can give to ourselves, and it is one that brings me a great amount of joy; using our creativity and sharing it with others is just one way we can serve others.</p>



<p>What is it that brings you the most joy? Maybe it’s spending time with those you love. Little children are full of creativity, and are quick to pick up on new ideas and concepts. I’m glad that my parents didn’t squelch my creativity when I was growing up. It would have been easy to have done, but they didn’t and, for that, I am thankful.</p>



<p>There are so many choices available when it comes to being creative. One friend sows. Several of my friends take pictures. It was probably after I met Tim LaHay that I decided that I wanted to be a writer, and about 18 years after that that I actually began writing on a regular basis.</p>



<p>If you have something that you enjoy doing, great, keep working on it. If not, maybe you can try something new. There are so many things to choose from. You just need to pick one and get started. You may be surprised at how well you do.</p>

<p>Feeling stuck. Not sure how to get out of the daily grind? Maybe you just want to try something different but aren’t sure where to start. Here are some ideas that may help.</p>



<p>Start small. Take a moment to write down a list of things that you would like to start doing: exercising, eating more vegetables, remembering to feed your dog, for example. Find a place to put this list where you can see this list each morning and throughout the day. I have mine on a dry eras board. If you want to walk each day, start out with a two to ten minute walk. On weekends, I may walk three hours or more, but I try to walk a little each day, even if it’s to the fridge.</p>



<p>Try joining a church, a church small group for larger churches, or a club. Volunteer for a local charity or for the library. There are so many organizations that can use volunteer help.</p>



<p>Seek a new job/career or get a second job. You may have to do this if you loose your current job for whatever reason. Hopefully, this doesn’t happen, but it happens all the time. It can seem like a good thing, but often, it does’t. Either way, put your energy into finding something new and, if possible, exciting.</p>



<p>Take up a hobby. There are so many to choose from. Just within art there is photography, watercolor, pastel, color pencil, charcoal, those little fluffy things and so much more. You may even want to take a class that can help you learn a craft and may help you meet others who are also interested in art.</p>



<p>Teach a class. I found a local store, Natural Grocers, that allows me to use their kitchen to teach a class. They also provide me with up to $100 groceries to use as a demo. They do have rules that I am required to follow but nothing too difficult. I’ve only done one class but another is scheduled for next month. Just make sure that, if you decide to teach your class that you know your subject. Curiosity helps, too.</p>



<p>Find others to go for walks with. There may be a local photography club, too, as well as writers and speakers clubs. You should be able to do a Google search for local clubs.</p>



<p>The greatest/best change in my life came when I put my faith in Jesus to pay my sin debt and restore a relationship with God. John 3:16 (KJV) tells us that, <strong>“ For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</strong> It gives us what we cannot earn and what none of us deserve: forgiveness, wholeness and eternal life. Some things, we get as soon as we accept God’s gift, while other things take a lifetime to change. A prayer of salvation is just the beginning.</p>



<p>Change can be hard at times, especially if it is forced on us. But it doesn’t have to be. It’s our decision as to whether we see change as a good or bad thing. Try to see it as a good thing. In one way, change will occur, with or without us.</p>



<p>Note: I’m not talking about some changes that others may try to force upon us. Even a lie can seem true if you hear it often enough. Keep an open mind to differing views and you should be able to decide what to think about differing issues on your own. Is there a write and wrong? In some cases, yes, but in others, no. You are the one who decides which is which, at least in your own mind. And this, too, may change over time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Question: How could two little words have so many meanings? But they do.</p>



<p>I remember that as a child, our family had a record player. It played 45’s and the records were about 1/3 the size of the larger records. The first record that I bought for myself was by Keith Green. I remember that I took all the money that I had at the time and — with the help of the cashier — purchased that album. I’m not sure how many times I listened to it but knowing me, it was probably several.</p>



<p>My brother, on the other hand, had a job and so he purchased a sound system. I liked to use it too. He preferred groups like Meatloaf and others that I don’t recall. I liked love songs from Styx, Chicago and Boston.</p>



<p>When CD’s came out, I got one. It took a while before I actually got a CD player. Or maybe it was the other way around.</p>



<p>My first CD was by Michael Card and I know I drove my sister crazy as I listened to it over and over. I know because she told me.</p>



<p>Keeping: having, owning, holding, possessing or maintaining. If you don’t keep something, you sell it or give it away.</p>



<p>Records: any document — printed material — mental, analog or digital. A record may be a physical piece of paper, but it may also be a memory, a 45 album or a photograph. These are just some examples. A $1 bill is a record of a certain percentage of value based on something. It used to be gold, but I’m not sure what it is now.</p>



<p>First Corinthians tells us that love, among other things, “it keeps no record of wrongs.” It tells us that we may have other gifts and we may do great things, “but do not have love, I gain nothing.”</p>



<p>The Bible also tells us that God is love. So, it could be said that if we do not have God, we do not have love and therefore we gain nothing from this life that we live.</p>



<p>What’s required to find God?</p>



<p>Scripture: it could be Genesis 1: 1 that says, “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.” (KJV)<br>Faith: so if you believe in your heart what God says, you have part of it.<br>Confession: It’s confession that, one, I am a sinner and that I need God’s help and, second, that I put my faith in the completed work of the only Son of God. If Jesus was just a teacher or a good guy, he could’t save anyone. And if you think about it, he really did clam to be equal to God and that’s why they killed Jesus.</p>



<p>I don’t remember my prayer because I was too shy to pray out loud. I did believe in my heart, though, and the confession came soon after at baptism. And, if you don’t know, baptism cannot save anyone. Tongues are not a sign of being born again; they are simply a gift for self edification and, perhaps, for the church. I think things like serving and teaching, giving to the church are more prevalent gifts these days. Healing would be nice, but I think it goes back to faith, not need.</p>



<p>Here’s a sample prayer: “God, forgive me. I confess that I am a sinner and that I need Your forgiveness. I accept your gift of salvation that you offer because of the promise in John 3: 16 (“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” — KJV). Thank you for this free gift.”</p>



<p>When you do this, you are sealed with the Holy Spirit, Saved and given eternal life. It’s so simple, and adult can get it.</p>



<p>If you have questions, please email me: ralfie517@gmail.com. Put “Question” in the “about” line. If you have a prayer request, put “Prayer”. If you just want to let me know that you’ve put your faith in Jesus, put “Yes.” This will help me sort though all of the junk that I get to find what I really need to focus on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Warming: the following material could be heartbreaking. If you like, you may skip to the end.</strong></p>



<p>At Some point of our lives, each of us is a victim. It may be a crime, such as theft or vandalism. It may be abuse: sexual, emotional or physical. For all too many, life begins and ends with the abuse known as freedom of choice. Most of us just fall victim to the results of our own choices.</p>



<p>Each persons behavior is based on what he or she sees in other, on television and in movies, or listens to in the form of others or the music that that individual listens to. So someone who has been hurt by others — “You’re such a dummy” — is more likely to hurt others. Crime, gossip and abuse don’t begin with the act, they begin with a though.</p>



<p>“Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.” — Matthew 5: 21-22 (KJV)</p>



<p>God is much more concerned about our thoughts — our heart — than our our intents. It’s not intentions that lead to action; it’s our thoughts. We do, however, have the ability to stop when we see a negative though forming in our mind. We can stop and think. Unfortunately, not everyone realizes that he can change his thought pattern. And it we constantly feed on violence and a thought of hatred enters our mind, violence is likely to ensue.</p>



<p>It is important who and what we listen to. Television and movies are often meant to instill fear. They cause us to laugh at the wrong thing — mainly sin and perversion. Music can cause us to believe the wrong things, and material found of the Internet can cause thoughts of anything from fear to jealousy and lust.</p>



<p>Just one statistic shows that “22% of individuals assaulted by a partner at least once in their lifetime (23% for females and 19.3% for&nbsp; males).” Unfortunately wether the perpetrator realizes his/her abuse or not, whether the victim realizes their abuse or abuser or not, most people lack the resources to do anything. The sad part is that all too many victims are too young to recognize abuse and certainly too young to express what they may have experienced. “This must be normal,” one tells himself.</p>



<p><strong>You can pick up here if you like.</strong></p>



<p>I think I’ve made my point. At some time, each of us a victim. Now comes the choice: we say “Yes, I am a victim, and I deserve to be angry, resentful or bitter. Where’s my phone? I need to call a lawyer.” But that’s not the answer. What we should do is turn to the Savior: our Great Physician.</p>



<p>You can start wit the book of John <a href="http://Book of John https://content.wtsbooks.com/shopify/pdf_links/9781433558955f.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(PDF)</a>. Or you can start with verses like:</p>



<p>“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” — John 3:16 (KJV)</p>



<p>“That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” — Romans 10:9 (KJV)</p>



<p>Faith is a process that begins as a seed, takes root in the Word of God and beings to grow. A relationship with our Savior isn’t a religion and it’s not something that we can do on our own. We need to go to God and simply trust in the finished work of Jesus, his death on the cross to pay for our sins and his resurrection. We need to believe that Jesus, born of a virgin, lived a perfect and sinless life, was both fully God and fully man so that he could save us from our sins and restore the relationship with God that you and I truly long for.</p>



<p>It may begin with a prayer like this: “God, thank you for sending your only son to die to pay for my sins. I’m confessing that I’m a sinner and I ask you to forgive me, not because of anything that I do, but because of Jesus’ precious blood, spilt on a cross to pay my sin debt.”</p>



<p>What next: Find a church that teaches the Bible: preferably only the Bible, and doesn’t try to fill your mind with self help books and platitudes. If you find such a church, become a member. Hint, if the church is growing, it may be a good church. Visit that church and listen to who and what they talk about. Baptism is important, but not a requirement and it doesn’t give anyone eternal life. Spiritual gifts are a matter for another time.</p>



<p>If ever you feel threatened by someone or feel that your life may be in danger and cannot say, “I need the police to come help me,” dial 911 and press send. When the operator answers, say, “Yes, I’d like to order a pizza.” The operator with know what to do.</p>



<p>There are also videos that can help victims of abduction and sex trafficking: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GfsS4HH2Uw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Link to video</a></p>



<p>Parents should talk to their kids about what victimization looks like. Don’t frighten then but give them ideas of what they might do if someone approaches them. Practice situations that your child may experience and, by all means, keep lines of communication open, which means that you may have to confess your own faults and failures. After all, there’s no better teacher than personal experience. And admitting our own failures won’t kill us or make us look likes less of a person — except to the one who is out to get us.</p>

<p>There is help out there. If you see someone who looks like she needs help, take time to get to know that person. Ask questions.<br>If you could go anywhere in the world, where would you go?<br>What’s you’re favorite sport, color, food…<br>What are your plans for upcoming holiday/weekend?</p>



<p>Finally, be a friend. Find someone who seems isolated.  Offer her a Pop-tart a smile and some encouragement.  Find out what kind of music he or she likes. Just start talking. Just show that you care. And smile. Keep your smile, it still works and it looks good on you.</p>

<p>This morning, as I walked out in the dark of night to drive to work, I took a moment to gaze up into the sky and admire the beauty that I had so often seen at other times in my life, in other parts of the world.</p>



<p>As you probably already know, I grew up next to the University of Arkansas where I was able to do far more than just become a Razorback fan. One summer, I decided to take World Literature and Astronomy at the same time. This was when I was told that I couldn’t write (well). I made a C, if I remember correctly, or maybe it was a B, in World Lit and dropped out of the Astronomy class. I guess you could say that it was a bit over my head. I did stay in the Astronomy Lab class and actually did very well in it.</p>



<p>Because of the University of Arkansas, we — my family and I, along with the other students that I went to school with —had access to telescopes as well as a planetarium. Like many photographers, one of my main interests was astrophotography and, though I delivered newspapers, the equipment necessary to attach my camera to a telescope or to track stars for longer exposures always seemed out of reach.</p>



<p>According to space.com, “There are 88 officially recognized constellations in the sky.” Genesis tells us that the sun, moon and stars were created for signs and seasons, but it was the Greeks who are the first known students of Astronomy, giving the constellations names after their gods.</p>



<p>Not to be confused with astrology, there are still questions about what is out there, in spite of the years of study. At least now, we have a much better understanding of just how big the universe is. And wither you believe in evolution or creation, objects from space have clearly had a major impact on this planet.</p>



<p>Space captures our imagination and can keep us awake at night. I’ve seen the movies, and I’ve seen the magazines at the checkout stands. Who can forget “Star Trek” or “Star Wars”? One of the first movies created was of a rocket launch to the moon, years before we actually sent astronauts to the moon. “Capricorn One ” was probably my favorite movie when it came out in 1978. And I might have finished reading the book if I hadn’t left it out in the rain. “Greenland” seems like it might be a good movie, but it seems way too intense. I’m hoping that they come out with a book for that movie, but nothing yet.</p>



<p>Whatever you think about what is out there, or where you stand on space exploration, it’s clear that, wherever you live, we can all enjoy the beauty of the night sky. The view may have not changed over the years, but the beauty of the night sky never grows old, and there is still much to learn.</p>
