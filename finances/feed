<p>When it comes to our finances, there are a few rules that we should keep.</p>



<p><strong>Plan ahead</strong><br>One of the best ways to save money is to plan ahead. Have a budget, and stick to it. Plan your menus, and only buy what you can afford. Look for sales ahead of when you might need to make purchases.</p>



<p><strong>Pay yourself</strong><br>Set money aside for your future self. Call if an emergency fund or a fun fund. Emergency funds should have anywhere from $1,000 to three months take home pay, or more.</p>



<p><strong>Keep it simple</strong><br>One of the simplest ways to budget is to cash your check and put the money into envelopes. You may have envelopes for rent, food, gas and so forth. Each gets either a certain amount of money, or a percentage of your pay. If, for example, you have $100 for food, you have to figure out how to make that money last until next pay day.</p>



<p>If you don’t know where to start, begin by writing out some of your goals. Make sure that these goals are realistic, and give them a deadline. Take a look at where you are, and figure out small steps that you can take to get to where you want to go.</p>



<p><strong>Reward yourself</strong><br>Each time you take a step towards your goal, or whenever you reach a goal, remember to reward yourself. It could be as simple as a little cheer. Congratulate yourself. Pat yourself on the back. These small rewards can make you feel better about the direction you are taking, and help keep you on the right path.</p>



<p>Don’t put it off; the sooner you get started, the better. Make commitments to yourself, and respect yourself enough to stick to them. Your future self just may thank you for it.  Do these things and never forget that God is the one who provides for all of our needs.  </p>

<p>Somewhere, someone is working on the latest thing that we all need. It’s faster or smaller than the one before it and it can do things that we only hoped for just a few years ago.</p>



<p>Maybe you find it easy to save money and you enjoy doing it. I have done a little investing, and that’s kind of fun. Trying to pick the right stock and sometimes getting it right is kind of fun. But I don’t find saving all that exciting and, most of the time, I find it really hard.</p>



<p>It’s too easy to focus on the things that I want or need now. When I was in my twenties, I wasn’t thinking about when I would be in my forties or fifties. And when I was in my twenties, I had no idea what I would need at this time of my life.</p>



<p>Schools leave us may teach us the math needed to balance our bank accounts, but the really don’t teach us anything about our finances. For many, college is a time of getting into debt, and credit card companies are happy to give most of us credit as long as we have a pulse.</p>



<p>Maybe what we should do is make saving money fun. Maybe we could find a way to make a game out if it, like a board game or something. Maybe we could compete with others to see who is able to save up the most money. Just a thought.</p>



<p>Really, when it comes to our finances, we need to start with figuring out which direction that we want to take our lives. Without direction, it is hard to get anywhere.</p>



<p>If you truly want to save, it takes a plan. Like taking a road trip, you need to know where you wan to go so that you can make a plan to get there. Remember, however, that plans can change. There may be roadblocks and detours to your financial plans, but that doesn’t mean that you have to give up.</p>



<p>One other thing, whether we have a little or a lot, we need to trust God with our money. After all, it belongs to God, anyway. It may or may not be exciting giving a part of our money back to God and his work though the church, but God does promise a peace that passes all understanding to those who put their trust in him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I once heard the formula for making money: buy (low), sell (at a profit) and repeat. It’s pretty easy, if you can find a product or a number of products that sell well. And there are a number things to choose from.</p>



<p>Services<br>A service is something that you do over and over. You have a trade that someone else needs — plumbing, electrical work, auto repair, doctoring, or accounting — and you provide high quality service that people are willing to pay for.</p>



<p>Product<br>This may be something that you make yourself or something that you buy from a manufacturer. In case of a grocery or other store, you may deal with one or more vendors. More and more, stores are moving out of traditional brick and mortar stores and moving online, having either items in a warehouse, such as Amazon, or made to order and shipped to customers.</p>



<p>Investing<br>There are different items that individuals usually invest in. One is making a financial investment, usually through the purchase of stocks or bonds. Investors like Warren Buffett have a unique way of investing. Initially, Mr. Buffett purchased stocks, When he had enough money, he purchased the company Berkshire Hathaway, and consolidated all of his money into this company. Over time, Mr. Buffett has added more and more companies into his company and, at times, has been the richest man in the United States.</p>



<p>Another type of investment is real estate. Someone buys a type of some type of property, such as a house, apartment complex or a mall and uses to this property to make money. Some people fix up a piece of property and sell it for a profit. Others collect properties and use rent money, not only for paying back any loans, but also for making a profit.</p>



<p>It’s said that fortune favors the wealthy. The good news is that anyone with the desire to do so can put in the effort and amass wealth of some type. Countless individuals have moved to the United States with nearly nothing and have been able to build wealth for themselves and their family. Others have gone from being homeless to having millions in investments. But these stores are few and far between.</p>



<p>Yes, there are dangers in investing or selling, but there is also a danger in doing nothing. Over time, money looses it’s value and, if we don’t have a plan to grow our money, the money that we have today won’t buy as much as much tomorrow.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many of us think that we need to have everything now and that credit is required to buy what we need. This has allowed manufactures to raise the prices on goods and creators to make millions of dollars off of those whom they lend their money to. This may be good for the banker, but it can put individuals into a vicious cycle that can be difficult to get out of.</p>



<p>My advise, and I’ve learned this from making numerous mistakes of my own, is to start small and grow over time. Yes, there are the people like Sam Walton who took our millions of dollars of loans to start Walmart. It helped that he was the loan officer who loaned himself that much money. But for every story of a Sam Walton, there are numerous others who crashed and burned.</p>



<p>An oak tree starts as a small seed. In the first few years, it hardly seems like anything at all but, given time, it becomes a mighty oak tree. The thing isn’t to start big but to just get started. And the earlier that one gets started, the better. But be careful, it’s just as easy to get started with debt, and once someone gets into debt, it’s hard to get out.</p>

<p>Money and values<br>Did you know that the Bible mentions money more than 800 times? Money does several things. It is a tool that allows us to do the things that we want to do, taking place of the barter system. But money also shows us what is important to us.</p>



<p>When we get paid, if we work for someone else, we pay a portion of our income to our government in the form of taxes. This amount varies in amounts and in percentages. Many of us get money back at the end of the year, while others winding up having to send in a check, but taxes always have to be paid.</p>



<p>Some people give away a percentage of their income. If you give a tenth of your income, to a church or some other charitable organization, it’s called a tithe. The Bible tells us that everything that we receive, whether we realize it or not, comes from God and that we should give a portion back to him. Some say that it should be 10 percent, but others say that it is “whatever God puts on your heart to give.” I admit that it’s not always easy to give, but it is always a good idea.</p>



<p>Next, one should “pay” him or herself. This means taking money and setting it aside for the future. It can be in the form of an emergency fund, a fun fund, or something to be used to build up investments that, hopefully, outdo inflation.</p>



<p>One of the most important things that a person needs to survive is shelter, so rent or a mortgage would come next. And, so you don’t loose your property at some point in the future, it’s a good idea to include taxes in the equation, if applicable.</p>



<p>Utilities come next, unless you want to be cold in the winter or hot in the summer. There’s also water and, if you like, telephone and internet. Cable would likely fall under entertainment.</p>



<p>It’s also a good idea to spend a portion of your income on food, unless you are the Dragon Warrior (from “Kung Fu Panda”). I know that a person can survive on about $20 US a month on Raman noodles, but that kind of diet isn’t going to lend to long term health, and peanut butter and jelly isn’t much better. How much you want to spend on food is up to you. Consider your overall budget and use your best judgment.</p>



<p>There are going to be other bills: petrol or travel, auto repairs or bus fair. Car insurgence may be one of the bills. You may think that you don’t need money for entertainment, but you likely will. And clothes wear out, so include it.</p>



<p>Debts should be a small part of what our money goes to. Unfortunately, credit card companies, who will give a credit card even to a dog, make it super easy to get into debt at a young age, and make it very hard to get out. In addition, the cost of education has gone through the roof and can make it hard to set any money aside at the time when we most need to start investing.</p>



<p>Finally, there are things. We all want things, but we have to consider what they are worth to us. Not only do “things” take away the money that we could give back to God, but they take away from the money that we can invest in ourselves and in our future. If we put our money in things, unless they are truly investments, we are putting money into things that won’t last, will need repair and that will need to be taken care of. It’s okay to have things, but not at the cost of our freedom.</p>



<p>A budget is a good way to track all of this spending. It can be as complicated as software that helps us track where our money is going, or as simple as a system using envelopes that hold cash for each category of spending. Whoever you spend your money shows what you really value. As Matthew 6:21 (KJV) puts it, “For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”</p>



<p>Where are your treasures? Do you put your money in things that will or will not last. It’s okay to have some of each but, remember, that balance is key. And the choices are up to you.</p>

<p>James 1: 5-6 (KJV) tells us that, “If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.”<br>Often, we lack faith because we aren’t really sure what we believe. Any time we start anything new, it takes time to learn what we need to know. Hopefully, we can learn the fundaments early, but that may take years. Studies like law and medicine, and even culinary arts can take years to master and, still, one can never learn everything that there is to learn. Odd thing is that there are a wide variety of opinions in any field of study. And religion is no exception.<br>If we aren’t sure what we believe, it’s easy to be swayed by the latest thing that we’ve heard. It is important, therefore, to be careful who we are listening to. At the same time, it can be good to seek out different opinions, even if we think that we’ve already heard it all.</p>



<p>Current social media is often set up to flood us with one view, while sometimes blocking other options, whether by our choice or by the choice of an algorithm, or both.<br>Not knowing affects other areas of our lives, too. Studies have shown that, the earlier people know their life’s path, the more successful they will be in reaching their goals. Not knowing what we want to do can cause us to waste not only money, but years of our lives. Yet, even if we missed getting an early start, it’s never too late to decide what we want to do with our lives.<br>There are a few things that can help us determine what we might do next. We cannot say that what we do next will determine the rest of our lives, for too much is outside our control. But we can decide what direction we would like to take.<br>The first thing that we can do is to write down some goals. If you don’t know where you want to go, it becomes easy to live life in a rut, where it may seem like we aren’t getting anywhere. Yet, even these times can teach us something. I like to use a computer to type out my goals.<br>Be specific. Instead of writing that you want make a lot of money and retire early, determine how much money that you need to retire, when you would like to retire, a date you will start saving and a clear plan on how much you will need to save or invest each year between now and retirement. Also, have a clear idea of what you want retirement to look like. Do you want to live on a beach or a mansion?<br>Be realistic. It’s okay to dream big. One of my favorite books was Ann Kiemel’s book, “I Love the Word Impossible,” where she talks about dreaming things that only God can do. But I do not want and will never play pro football in the NFL, and I will never become a sky diver. No thank you. But there are lots of things that I can decide that I want to do and, though I may never perfect any particular skill, I can get better at just about anything I work at.<br>Another thing we can do is to talk to friends — those that know us best. Find out what they think that we are or might be good at. Years ago, someone told me that I should have been a librarian because of my many interests. Today, I use that in my blog.<br>Finally, start small. Intentionally, figure out what the least you can do is and do that. If you want to run a marathon, start with a five or ten minute walk. Don’t try, on day one, to run 5 or 6 miles because you are much more likely to give up. Do this with any new habit that you want to incorporate into your routine. I made a list of things that I want to do each day on a dry erase board and I check them off as I do them. My list has 16 things to do and I don’t put things that I’m already in the habit of doing. This can also help limit the time that we spend checking emails, taking phone calls and checking social media.<br>Being free to do whatever can be nice, but having and reaching goals can give us a sense of purpose. It can also help keep us from waking up and realizing that we’ve “wasted” our time on this Earth. Knowing what we believe also helps us when we pray. And if you need wisdom, ask God.</p>

<p>What is of greater value than money? No, it’s not toilet paper. It’s not gold, silver or even platinum. It’s not rubies or diamonds. It’s not our houses or our cars, our careers or our status in society. Imagine, ice cream doesn’t even make the list.</p>



<p>So what’s the answer. There are a few.</p>



<p><strong>Time</strong><br>Time, along with all of the rest of the items on this list, is something that we cannot buy. No amount of money can buy us more time, and no amount of money can make us younger or take us back in time. Once spent, time is gone. Solomon said that we ought to do everything in moderation. Use your time wisely, but make sure that you have fun along the way.</p>



<p><strong>Health</strong><br>Even Sam Walton and Steve Jobs did not have enough money to keep death at bay forever. And the same is true for the richest men on the planet today. It’s true for all of us. The Bible tells us that it is appointed unto man to die, once and only once. Anyone who has not yet died, at one point will. It is a result of sin, and cannot be changed. We have many opportunities to keep our health, but few to get it back once it is lost. Some may get their lives back after a short period of physical death. Lazarus was dead for three days, as was Jesus. Lazarus died again soon after. Jesus received a glorified body. Take care of your health. It’s of greater value than we truly understand, until it’s gone.</p>



<p><strong>Relationships</strong><br>I heard a joke that said: “if a 65 year old man has a 22 year old wife, how much money does he have.” So, to an extent, we can buy relationships. If not relationships, we can at least buy companionship. Yet when it comes to the deeper relationships, like the one that out to be between a husband and a wife, parent and child and close friends, these we cannot buy. Perhaps most importantly, we cannot buy a relationship with the living God. It is a free gift offered to all men and women, paid for by Jesus Christ and received by faith. Nothing that we can do or possess can get us into Heaven. As the old hymn says, Jesus paid it all.</p>



<p><strong>Reputation</strong><br>“A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favour rather than silver and gold.” — Proverbs 22:1 (KJV) I dare say that not even a good credit rating is better than a good name or, in other words, a good reputation. It too, is something that you cannot buy. It comes not only with the respect of others but with self respect, and you cannot buy it, you have to earn it.</p>



<p>We can buy an education, but cannot buy wisdom. We can buy popularity but cannot buy respect. We can even buy votes, but cannot buy servitude, loyalty or integrity. We can buy people, but we cannot buy love, at least not Biblical love. To an extent, we can buy outer beauty, but we cannot buy outer beauty or character. We can buy momentary happiness, but we cannot buy a lasting joy. And, most importantly, we cannot buy eternal life.</p>



<p>What is the value of money? It’s the value that we place on it. In reality, it’s the value of the dollar when compared with an ounce of gold. We tend to think that it’s the value of the gold that changes, but it’s really the value of the dollar. We exchange or money for those things that we think are of equal or greater value than the money that we spent. We give it away in hopes of doing good for ourselves and others. We spend days and weeks trying to capture it, often to release it in moments.</p>



<p>Yes, we ought to save. Yes, we ought to invest. But remember that the things that we can obtain in this life often don’t last into eternity. It’s something to think about as we go through this life, and as we make our day to day decisions. In reality, God is the true owner, anyway. We’re just stewards of what God has given us.</p>

<p>Money is a lot of things, and it is not the same thing to everyone. It seems that all of us, no matter how much we have, we want more. Yet it’s not the money that makes or breaks us, but the things that we do or fail to do with the money that we have.</p>



<p>Whether we like it or not, money, and how we use it can also tell us a lot about ourselves. Money shows us were our value are, what’s important to us, and whether or not we have self control, among other things. I do not believe that that having lots of money somehow gives us a form of Godliness as some believe, nor is wealth always gained by honest means. Money should not separate us, but often it does.</p>



<p>Money is a tool, allowing us to do the things that we want and helpings us to get the things that we need. I say helping, because getting the things that we need may depend on things outside of our control.</p>



<p>Our view of wealth is based mostly on those around us, our view of those around us, and our view of what is most important. Our view of wealth is also shaped by our faith as well as by our past.</p>



<p>It’s quite easy to see that wealth is not evenly disbursed. Compared to those who own and live in bigger houses, drive nicer cars and have and earn more money, I’m not all that rich. But compared to those who may have one set of clothing, live in a shack, struggle to get food and water, worry about their and their family’s safety and do not have the freedom to worship God as they choose, I might be considered very rich.</p>



<p>Credit and debt also allow us to buy the things that we want right now. The use of credit can also tell us a lot about ourselves. And while it’s easy to assume that things will only continue to get better, wisdom teaches the wise to prepare for lean times, times when there is no money or there are no crops. And though create can give us what we want now, it can be a trap that keeps us from what we need in the future. Plus, the thing that we want now may not be something that we want in the future.</p>



<p>Yes, money is a tool, but remember that it is not the only tool. To only think of money when it comes to getting the things that we want is to limit our thinking. Often wisdom and hard work are more important than how much money we have in our bank account at any given time. Farsightedness can be of more value than years of education.</p>



<p>The Bible has a lot to say about money. It you want wisdom on how to deal with money, this is where you should look, beginning with Proverbs. This life is short in light of eternity. And the picture that we paint with our lives isn’t made up of the things that we hope to do, but in the details of the little things that we actually do. These are the things that we really should take the time to think about.</p>

<p>Saving Money</p>



<p>Rumor has it that Monday may be eliminated due to budget cuts. Also, the light at the end of the tunnel has been turned off to conserve energy.  Actually, there are ways to cut expenses that may help with your finances. Here are some ideas that may help.</p>



<p>Use natural light whenever possible to help reduce your electric bill. You may be able to find light bulbs that use less electricity. Or, you may use a fan instead of air conditioning.</p>



<p>Using coupons may help when you go grocery shopping, but I find that they are mostly designed to make you buy things that you may not normally buy. Instead, I find it better to plan ahead and prepare ahead. Making a menu and a grocery list can help prevent buying those foods that you don’t really need. Also, preparing food ahead and storing it for future use can help save both time and money.</p>



<p>Budgeting is another way that you can use planning to save money. The further out you can budget your money, the better. You may find extra money, or you can find out that you really can’t afford that $4 coffee every morning.</p>



<p>Carpooling can be another way to save money. It may take some effort to find someone whom you can share a ride with, but it may be worth it.</p>



<p>Look at your subscriptions and see if any of them can be reduced or eliminated. Hulu, for example has two levels: one with advertising and one without. If you subscribe to the one without advertising, you may find that your can put up with some advertising in order to lower your cost. You may also decide that you can drop some subscriptions, completely. You may not realize all the subscriptions that you have, but they are easily found on your bank statements, credit card statements, or online.</p>

<p>One area where we can set goals for the New Year is in the area of finances. We can follow the SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timed) method of setting goals and, while the measurable part of it may come easy, the others may be a little harder.</p>



<p>This is because circumstances can change. Wages can go up or down, cost of living can change, things happen that we can’t predict. But even the unknown should’t keep us from setting goals when it comes to our finances.</p>



<p>One goal that should be top of the list, if it isn’t already, is having an emergency fund. This ranges from $1,000 to three months living expenses. This one is so important because it can help with achieving any other financial goal, like getting out of debt, or saving to buy a new car.</p>



<p>Another goal that everyone should consider, if you haven’t already, is creating a livable budget. And even if you have one, it might be a good time to review it. There are several budget styles to choose from, whether it be based on dollar amounts, or on percentages. And whether you pay yourself first, or set aside a certain percentage, there should be some money that goes to the future you.</p>



<p><strong>Below are other examples of the financial goals you can set for next year.<br>Save %10 of each pay check to put into savings or other investments.<br>Save $300 each month to put towards a new car.<br>Find at least one area where I can invest my money.<br>Find a financial/tax advisor.<br>Add one extra stream of income.<br>Consider where you might be able to give money away, and how much.<br>Pay down debts, or even pay them off.<br>Save for a large purchase.<br>Save for a vacation.<br>Start saving for next Christmas.<br>Put money aside for your own education or for that of your children.<br>Start your own business, or set aside money to use while you get you business up and running.</strong></p>



<p>Having a financial plan, and reviewing it regularly can help reduce stress in your life as well as in the lives of your family. In addition, writing down your goals will greatly increase your chances of reaching them.</p>



<p>Though, you may not want to share your financial goals with others, you may want to have someone you trust check on you from time to time, to make sure you are making progress toward your goals.</p>



<p>Remember, when it comes to investments and finances in general, there are risks. One piece of advise that I can offer is that, before you invest in anything, or trust anyone with your money, do your homework.</p>

<p>Our emotions probably affect more of our decisions than we realize. But when it comes to our money, our emotions may not always be the best source of financial wisdom. In spite of all of the advertising and product placement that lures us to make that unexpected purchase, emotional decisions often leave out a lot of the information needed to make decisions that are in our best interest, and may even flat out lie.</p>



<p>Emotional decisions don’t take into consideration any future impact of our choices. They lead us to buy things on credit, where we could wait and buy them with cash, often at a savings. They lead us to buy now, instead of shopping around to find the best price, or even to buy things that we don’t necessarily need, instead of investing the same money towards our future selves.</p>



<p>Emotions also tell us that buying a certain item will make us happier, or somehow make our lives better. Some times it will, but more often than not, it is a feeling that doesn’t last, and goes away completely when we see someone with one that is better or newer than ours.</p>



<p>How can we work with our emotions when it comes to financial decisions? I don’t think we will ever 100% make every decision without some emotional input. But there are some options that may help.</p>



<p>First, set a limit to what you will spend on impulse purchases. It could be as little as a few dollars. A friend told me that she sets hers at $10. Anything over that amount gets put on a waiting list. If that item is still on the list after a month, it gets a green light.</p>



<p>Second, make two lists. On one side, put possible benefits of having that thing that you want to buy. In the other list, write down possible drawbacks. These two lists may help you make the best choice.</p>



<p>Third, remember to keep a budget. The simplest form of a budget is an envelope system. With this system, you cash each check, and place the money into envelopes designated for such things as rent, food, travel expenses and so on. If an envelope is empty, there is no more money for that expense. Whatever system you use, budgets are a helpful way of controlling spending.</p>



<p>Finally, use cash. It’s much easier to think of cash as something real than it is credit, or even debit. It’s easy to forget the small purchases that we make when we don’t use cash. Carrying cash makes it easy: if the money isn’t there, we can’t spend it.</p>
