<p>“<strong>Children are an heritage of the Lord” — Psalm 127:3</strong></p>



<p>Happy Aunt and Uncles Day. So, if my sister has a son, that makes me an uncle. If, instead, she has a daughter, does that make me an aunt? Just kidding.</p>



<p>If you happen to make it to Spokane, Washington, there is an amazing bookstore called Aunties. You should go if you have a chance.</p>



<p>If you have a niece for nephew, don’t bother trying to get them to mow the lawn with you. It may work but probably won’t. Instead, take them out to eat or to a movie of their choosing. You may want to read to him or her. Just have fun together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The power went out some time after 7:30 AM. I found out some time around 8 AM. It seems that the rain caused a tree limb to droop down low enough to hit a power line.</p>



<p>It’s an easy fix for the power company. But if I hadn’t seen the power company truck, I would not have known.</p>



<p>What if the power weren’t back on. What would I do if the power outage were more widespread? After a tornado hit neighboring towns a little over 2 years ago, the place where I work lost power for three days.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I have backup lights, and that’s a good place to start. But that’s only a start. I can’t make my instant coffee and, if the power were still out, I wouldn’t want to open my fridge.</p>



<p>So, what is it that I need if the power goes out for an extended time — say, a week or more?</p>



<p>Light<br>Light comes in handy. And, if you have light, it helps to see what you are doing. Along with that is the batteries to power that light.</p>



<p>Water<br>Water may be next, if the water fails to run. LifeStraws are also a good source of clean water. They filter water that is not drinkable and makes it drinkable.</p>



<p>Sheler<br>Assuming that there is no structural damage, as in an earthquake or tornado, some form of protection from the heat or cold may be needed. A battery powered fan may be useful. Extra blankets can also help; sleeping bags work, too.</p>



<p>Food<br>Canned goods may be important. Try to stick with things that you know that you will use, whether in an emergency or not. If you won’t eat it before it expires, you probably shouldn’t buy it.</p>



<p>Planning<br>This includes making plans of what to do if the power goes out. You may check to see if there is still radio. If there is, great. If not, wait. Phone service may or may not work. Check the weather to see if it is raining. You may also check to see if anyone else is without power. If they have power, it’s likely that the problem is in your home or apartment. If you know your neighbors, you may be able to help them with their needs.</p>



<p>Planning can help with a lot of issues in an emergency, such as a power outage. But it can’t solve every issue that might arise. I find that prayer goes a long way, too. In an emergency, teamwork goes much further. It’s a win-win situation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Do you want some good news? I think it’s good, tough you are welcome to disagree.</p>



<p>Deuteronomy 23: 35-36 (KJV) says, “To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste. For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.”</p>



<p>You know what this means? For me, it means I don’t need to judge others or worry about doing so. And, really, I have desire to judge others. It’s too hard to tell who is telling the truth and who is lying. It’s too hard to tell the motives for any given acton. It’s nearly impossible to walk in someone else’s shoes.</p>



<p>No, I don’t know way I do many of the things that I do. So how can I expect myself to be able to understand why others do the things that they do? Answer: I cannot.</p>



<p>Say, for example, I have two children. Say that the two get into a fight and, when confronted, each blames the other. It would be a mistake to choose one over the other, but that is the tendency. Instead, both should be equally punished. Right?</p>



<p>Perhaps, or perhaps not. Maybe the best thing to do would be to help the two to find a way to work it out: to mediate a deal between the two. Far above what punishment could do, this could be a true life lesson.</p>



<p>I don’t know about you, but I am all too quick to judge other’s motives or intent. And, when I do, it can have lasting and negative effects on me and on my relationships.</p>



<p>There is, however, one thing that we can do. We can be open with each other. If something bothers us, we can say, this thing that you are doing makes me uncomfortable. It hurts me when you…..</p>



<p>We should avoid saying things like, “You are a bad person,” and “I don’t like you.” These are things that probably aren’t true, or may be true for a short time. Really, “I don’t like you” is just a way of saying “I’m mad, or sad, or both.”</p>



<p>Instead of judging, I can listen. I can ask questions and try to figure out what went wrong. I can also offer possible solutions. If a fix to the problem is found, great. If not, it may take more time. If no solution is found, maybe one person or the other just don’t want to admit that he or she may be wrong. But, again, it’s not possible for me to know with 100% certainty. Only God knows, and only God can judge the heart.</p>



<p>“Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, ‘Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord’” — Romans 12:19 (KJV)</p>



<p>What do I take away from this? I can and should be more patient — with myself and with others. I don’t need to judge others or their motives. I don’t even really need to judge my own motives. Now, if I need help with a matter, I should find out the best person to talk to. If I need medical advise, I should talk to a doctor. If I need to know how to spell a work, I find that Google works well. If I’m part of a fight, I should realize that I am part of the problem. And when I come to this realization, I should stop, step back and ask, “What is the real problem?”</p>



<p>What do you think? I think that this is good news. But you are welcome to disagree.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Who am I to write about the heart of God? Who do I think I am? Oh, but it’s not really about me. It’s about God.</p>



<p>You may think of it this way. You are entering an intersection and you see a stop sigh. You may stop at that stop sign, or you may decide simply to slow down. After all, there are other cars approaching the intersection, and simply slowing down seems okay. You don’t say to the stop sign, “What right have you to tell me what to do.” It’s simply a sign.</p>



<p>Say, now, that you are entering another intersection. This time, however, there is a clearly marked, clearly visible police car parked near this intersection. I would venture to guess that you (and I) would be more careful to make sure that we stopped at that stop sigh.</p>



<p>Do I know everything about God? Certainly not. Nor can I know everything about you, partly because I don’t have all the answers regarding my own life. Yet, I walk in a relationship with the living God, not because of anything that I have done, but because of the things that God has done. I, by no means feel worthy to write about the heart of God, but I believe that He has put this on my heart. So, it is by faith that I begin writing. And I am trusting God, though His Spirit, to guide me each step along the way as to what I should and should not write.</p>



<p>No, I’m not a stop sign and this material is not designed to make or even to help you stop doing something. Rather, think of it as one of those signs that point you to the highway that you need to take, the gas station where you need to stop or to the hospital that you need to visit. As with any sign, we all need help getting to the place(s) that we need to go. I believe that God gives us signs — that all of creation is one big sign pointing to Him. I also believe that God gave us His written word, the Bible, to point us to Him. And that is what I will base my writing on.</p>



<p>You may or may not agree with the things that I write. However, like the stop sign, I do not care what you may think of me. But the one in the police car may care what you do.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong. God is not waiting for us to mess up so that He can punish us. The truth is that we all have a problem called sin and death. This sin, because of who we are and who God is, separates us from God. God could have said, “Oh, well, they get what they deserve.” But that is not the heart of God. God would not and could not simply let us perish. He loves us too much to let that happen.</p>



<p>There is much that I will not write about. After many years of study and just plain listing to others, I am certainly ware of many of the different views on everything from creation to eschatology (the study of end times). My goal is not to show you that I am right. My goal is simply to let you know or, perhaps to remind you, that God loves you, whoever you are or however you may see yourself.</p>



<p>John 3: 16 (KJV) tells us, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</p>



<p>Oh, I still have questions. And there have certainly been times when I’ve had doubts — even about the love of God in my life. There have even been times when I felt as if I were on of God’s “Oops — how did that get through?” Trust me, my life is no mistake and neither is yours.</p>



<p>I hope this writing is a blessing: a blessing for both you and for me. By this, I don’t mean that God will give us the riches that we desire in this life but that we will be blessed riches of a relationship with the living God — the only one who can give us eternal life. Don’t break out the hats for the pity-party just yet. God has a plan for each of us, for this life and beyond. God loves you and me; that’s reason to celebrate.</p>

<p>There are at least a few books that talk about Heaven and what it is like. I’ve heard that Heaven is paradise. But that can mean different things to different people. No, there likely aren’t streams of ice cream that we can eat from continually, thought that would be nice. You see, the focus in Heaven isn’t us but on Jesus.</p>



<p>You see, when we get to Heaven, there will be no more worries. We won’t be wondering when the rapture is. We won’t be worried about any of the things that bother us in this life.</p>



<p>There will be no more sin: ours, that we can often be quite aware of, or those of others, which can so impact us in this life.</p>



<p>There will be no more death or sorrow. There will be no sickness or disease. There will be no loneliness or longing. Instead, there will be prefect peace and perfect love.</p>



<p>There will be perfect beauty, whatever that may look like. And the Bible tells us that we will know as we are known. You see, God knows us and yet He still loves us. Perhaps, this is because He sees us not as we are but as we will be.</p>



<p>One day, perhaps soon, God will take us home, caught up to be with Him. I don’t know exactly what Heaven will be like, but I know my Savior. And I’m looking forward to being with Him. By the way, no photo can do it justice.</p>

<p>What would your rather have?</p>



<p>A million dollars?<br>Free food for life?</p>



<p>A trip to Hawaii?<br>A trip to the country?</p>



<p>A free pass to any more for the rest of your life?<br>The ability to read any book in seconds?</p>



<p>A new car every year for the rest of your life?<br>A car that never needed repairs?</p>



<p>A personal chef for life?<br>A personal trainer for life?<br>The man or woman of your dreams?<br>To be the man or woman of someone else’s dreams?</p>



<p>A relationship with someone whom you think the be the most beautiful or most handsome?<br>A relationship of service and commitment to the other?</p>



<p>You might think that the last one is a trick question, but true, lasting relationships, thought they may begin with physical attraction, won’t last long if that’s all there is. That’s why so many relationships don’t last. A lasting relationship needs a commitment to the other person that goes deeper and seeks to serve and love the other.</p>



<p>“Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.” — 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 (NIV)</p>



<p>There’s nothing in that verse that talks about getting our own way or having things be perfect. In fact, if we keep looking for perfection, we will never find it. But if we seek to serve, whether it be others, or the God who created us, we will become more loving. And, as 1 Corinthians tells us, there is nothing is more important that we can do than love others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Who am I? It’s one of those deeper questions that we ask ourselves from time to time. And we may get a different answer each time.<br>I’m not entirely sure who I am. In short, I’m Ralph. I know who I’m not. I’m not the things I own, the people I know or the things that I have done. These things may help shape me, but they don’t make me who I am. Another thing I am not: I am not what I was and I am not yet who I will be.</p>



<p>I was 14 when I asked Jesus to be lord of my life, which was 43 years ago. After hearing the Gospel, I realized that I was a sinner and that God had sent His Son to die on a cross so that I might have eternal life.</p>



<p>Because I was so shy at the time, I couldn’t pray out loud. That has certainly changed. I’m no longer shy about praying out loud and some times as others if I can pray with and for them.</p>



<p>Anyone can become a follower of Jesus. We don’t have to live a particular lifestyle. We just need to have faith that Jesus can save us from our sins. Really, He is the only one who can. I cannot save myself from my sins. I put my faith in Jesus and God gave me eternal life. He also gave me the Holy Spirit to help guild me. If you like, you could say I’m born again.</p>



<p>What else is true? I am loved. I am fearfully and wonderfully made. I am a child of the living God. How about you? John 3:16 (KJV) says that, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” Are you a whosoever? I’m a whosoever.</p>

<p>What is it that we actually need? For me, it’s food, shelter, clothing, transportation, work, relationships and and personal items. But if you look at where I live, you might think that I need a lot more than just that.</p>



<p>A whole industry has popped up called self storage because of all of the things that we think we need. These self storage units aren’t cheap but they can’t seem to build enough of them. Some people have so many things that they buy their own unit and keep it on their property. If a home isn’t enough, you can build a separate building.</p>



<p>Why do we want or need so many things? Personally, I think it helps us fill in some of the holes left by a lack of relationships — the most important one being a relationship with our creator. If we can just get enough things, maybe we will be happy. What we really need is to know the God who created us.</p>



<p>The Bible tells us that God loves us so much that He sent His Son to die on a cross so that we might have eternal life. Jesus warned us not to spend too much time collecting things on earth because these things don’t last.</p>



<p>So, my camera, is it a want or a need. For me, having a camera is a high priority want. I could choose any camera that I want but it has to fall within my financial means. I chose a digital camera because I don’t have access to a darkroom. Photography helps me be creative and I think that’s important. Will that last into eternity? Probably not. But I enjoy it now.</p>



<p>I’m not suggesting you sell your belongings. But it is good to think about the things that really matter from time to time. What really matters to me? Relationships. I have my relationship with my Father in Heaven. But I could spend more time working on relationships where I am right now.</p>

<p>What do we know about ourselves? One of the first things that we learn is our name. Another thing that we learn is our relationship with others. Later, we learn what we are good at, what we enjoy and what we enjoy doing, as well as how to relate to others.</p>



<p>But there are some things that we may have to unlearn about ourselves. I don’t know about you, but I’ve spent much of my life seeing myself the way others see me. I’m “not good enough,” not, “smart enough,” and I’m “slow.”</p>



<p>I could see myself as being 57 years old or 57 years young. I could see myself as having X number of friends. I could see myself as having a certain amount of money in my bank account. But how does God see me, and what does the Bible say?</p>



<p>The book of Psalms tells me that I am fearfully and wonderfully made. The New Testament tells me that God loved me — loved us — enough to send His son to die on a cross so that I might have an eternal relationship with Him. The Bible tells me that that I’m of greater value than many sparrows, which God cares for.</p>



<p>So, it’s up to me. Do I choose to see myself as others see me — as I often see myself? Or, do I choose to believe what God’s Word says — how God sees me? We all have this choice.</p>

<p>Happy July 4th. Yesterday, I finished my first book in a series called “Letters from a Time Traveler.” It’s not much more than 3,000 words but, still, I’m excited about it. It comes on the heels of having finished my fourth LLGT Cafe magazine. And I’m certainly excited about that.</p>



<p>What gets you excited? Now, there are several things I enjoy: a long walk on a cool day, taking pictures, spending time with a friend or cooking a meal for friends are just some examples. However, few things really get me excited and finishing a writing project is one of them.</p>



<p>You probably already know that excitement produces endorphins in the brain and that is what makes us feel good. It’s too bad that these chemicals aren’t easier to produce. I think that social media can produce these chemicals, and that may be part of the reason that so many are addicted to social media. I consider myself a recovering addict.</p>



<p>Exercise is a better source than social media. Too many of us — myself included — get our “fix” on social media, passing by exercise or actual social interaction, and it’s sad. Real relationships involve risk. But relationships are worth that risk.</p>



<p>In the long run, exercise is much better than inactivity, even if it’s cooking a meal. I got one of those watches that tracks my activity. If I sit down too long, it lets me know. We don’t need to be excited all of the time. Unfortunately, if we don’t find it in things that we enjoy, then we are more likely to look for it in things that we would rather avoid.</p>



<p>So, what is it that gets you excited? For me, it’s the prospect of helping others.</p>
