<p>Today is Collector Car Appreciation Day. Try saying that three times fast.<br>It’s not just about old or fancy and unique cars. A while industry has been built around the automobile. Globally, revenue from just the sale of cars, themselves, was about $31.5 billon, with a growth rate of about 8%. That’s a lot of money and outdoes most stocks on the US Stock Exchange.</p>



<p><br>Aside from the cars, there is petrol, oil changes, car washes, hotel stays, advertising fees, photographers and models. It all adds up, and this money goes out to local businesses.<br>My dream car is a Mercedes, convertible from the early 1980s. I will probably never own one, but it’s nice to dream. It would likely be deep blue with brown leather seats.</p>



<p><br>What is your dream car?</p>



<p>For me, it’s more than a dream of having a particular car. I’m more than happy with the car that I have: a 2017 gray Jeep. I’m even happier that I’m no longer driving a 1991 van: ugly in every way.<br>For me, the Jeep reminds me that things can get better, no matter how I may feel at the moment. It’s also a reminder that my God is my source and my provider. And, because of this, I don’t have to worry about tomorrow.</p>



<p>If I begin to worry, as I am prone to do from time to time, I can go from 0 to panicked in .60 seconds. But, if I keep my eyes on God, and His Word in my heart (mind), there is really nothing to fear.</p>



<p><br>How can we celebrate Collector Car Appreciation Day? It may depend on where you live. If, for example, you live in a rural community, it may be that you or your neighbor has one of these in his or her yard. You may be able find a collector car at a local car dealership. You can also find photos and posters online. And there are car magazines. Finally, there are toy, model and remote control cars.<br></p>



<p>Perhaps, just learning something new is what matters. Personally, I would say that hope is what matters. And, it matters where we put on hope. My hope is in God: the Father, Son and Holly Spirit. Where do you find your hope?</p>

<p>If you are thinking about picking up and traveling, whether you plan on spending the year traveling around your area or you plan on spending some time in another country, there are more options now then there were just twenty or thirty years ago. Internet and high speed communication has not only allowed people in places outside of the United States to do jobs that once had to be done domestically but also allow people to take many jobs wherever they want.</p>



<p>You may not need a computer for this first one, though many restaurants use computers these days to keep track of their inventory. When I went into the military, I wanted something that I could use when I got out. I wasn’t interested in being a mechanic or learning something that might be so specialized that it would be of no use when I got out. Maybe you’ve heard of the degree in underwater basket weaving. It’s one of those jobs that it’s hard to find in the market place. Or maybe a degree in general studies.</p>



<p>It turned out that what I learned about cooking was only a small part of my culinary education. It did, however, lead to most of my international travel but certainly not most of my domestic travel.</p>



<p>Photography is another thing that I would like to do. I’ve been able to take pictures wherever I go, but I’ve never been able to do it professionally. The amount of money that I’ve made over the years likely wouldn’t pay even a month’s worth of rent, now. Yet there are wedding photographers, photojournalists and photographers who make YouTube videos who are able to travel to different parts of the world and make at least enough money to live off of.</p>



<p>One of my friends in Spokane had a business promoting concerts. This job took him over a wide area of the United States, with offices in at least a few states and at least a few hundred employees.</p>



<p>I have another friend who is a doctor. I’m not sure whether or not he travels, but I know that there are doctors who travel on missions trips, often offering free services in areas where medical help may be harder to find. There are even huge ships dedicated to helping people in these areas, all paid for by donations and run mostly by volunteers.</p>



<p>Speaking of volunteering, I knew someone who was planing to go to Hawaii to work on an organic farm. This work was volunteer work, but I guess he had enough money saved up that it wasn’t an issue for him. Some of the students from the culinary school where I attended went to places like New York City to work for top chefs on television programs, not for any money but for the ability to be able to put it on their resume and for the money that they might be able to make later in their careers.</p>



<p>If you can get your own television show, that may allow you to travel. Being in movies might do the same, though more and more movies these days do their travel virtually these days. If you can’t get a studio to pay your way, maybe YouTube or some other form of social media will.</p>



<p>If you can do well enough on Amazon, selling your products online or making money through affiliate marketing, then you should be able to pay your own way. I found one family on YouTube, The Kelley Krew, that was able to take to the road with a family of six, now seven, and spend that year in a large travel RV and truck.</p>



<p>There are other jobs as well that will allow you to travel, whether you are working for someone else or working independently: whether you require $100 thousand or more to get through the year or just a few hundred a month to get by. it’s all up to you. And, of course, local restrictions on travel.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve heard a lot of things about the traveling salesman: from stories of why one failed where another found success to jokes that I cannot repeat. I remember one story of a traveling vacuum cleaner salesman. After dumping a pile of dirt on a woman’s living room floor and said that, if his vacuum cleaner didn’t pick up all of the dirt that he would eat the dirt himself.<br>The story ends with the woman telling him to enjoy his meal because she had no electricity in her home.</p>



<p>My grandfather was a traveling salesman of sorts. Representing FTD in several states, he was able to visit large a large portion of the United States, going around and taking large orders from florists. Not only was he able to travel and to write off his travel expenses, but he was able to afford a nice home in New Orleans as well as many other things.</p>



<p>The idea of the traveling salesman isn’t new. It had been around for a long time. But, perhaps more than the invention of the automobile, the airplane, or the telephone, one thing has changed the role of the traveling salesman. That one thing is the computer.</p>



<p>You see, my grandfather probably wouldn’t be able to do what he did all those years ago in today’s world. For one thing, many of the smaller florists have gone out of business. Most flours are now sold in large grocery chains. And orders are placed on computers.</p>



<p>At the same time, the computer has opened up new markets. Instead of going door to door, seeing is done computer to computer over the internet. And the items that are being sold no longer have to be a physical object but may very well be a digital item, like a picture, an ebook, a song or a piece of software.</p>



<p>I’ll never forget the punch cards that my dad would have produced to create just one software program, or the fact that these cards would have to be redone if there was as little as one mistake in the code. I remember the funny noise that the modem made when first connecting one computer to another by phone, before the internet existed.</p>



<p>It wasn’t right away that the computer changed things. The first computers were as big as a bus and had hardly any memory at all. It took computers that could go into the homes of enough people, the software to operate these complex machines, high speed communication through the internet and the resources to buy these gadgets. The laptop needed batteries small enough and powerful enough to be able to take the computer anywhere, and the invention of the smartphone and tablet made the computer even more mobile and accessible.</p>



<p>Today, if we choose, we can work from just about anywhere we want. Though many parts of the world still have little or no internet access, these areas are shrinking and may one day disappear. And, while the number of opportunities have opened up immensely, so has the level of competition. So, as with everyone in life, the prize goes to the one who works the hardest and refuses to quit, no matter what: male or female.</p>
