<p>Today is National Cuban Sandwich Day. It is observed annually on August 23. Apparently, started as “fake news,” National Cuban Sandwich Day later became a real holiday, celebrating the Cuban sandwich, which was first made some time around 1870 or 1880. It is a traditional sandwich of Cuba and made its way to the the US by way of southern Florida.</p>



<p>Though there are many variations, the traditional Cuban sandwich is made using Cuban bread, ham or pork, cheese and pickles. The bread is coated with a thin layer of oil and it hot pressed.</p>



<p>There are numerous recipes online, if you want to make your own, of you can see if a local sandwich shop makes them. The sandwiches themselves range from simple to gourmet.</p>



<p>Today is also Buttered Corn Day, which is also observed each year on August 23. If you have corn on the cob or can get some, after cooking it, or perhaps as part of the cooking process, make sure to add butter. Maybe you can have some corn with your Cuban sandwich.</p>



<p>Finally, today is National Sponge Cake Day. Sponge cake can be served alone or with toppings. You may be able to purchase some from a local bakery or you can find a recipe online. Either way, it would make an excellent dessert.</p>

<p>Someone gave me a bag of chicken pars and it was a reminder that I needed to do certain things to keep myself safe. The chicken was frozen, but the bag was open, so I tied it before putting it into the refrigerator to thaw. I’m cooking it, now.</p>



<p>There are some general tips to keep in mind when safely handling meats that can help keep you and others from getting sick.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>*    Refrigerate or or freeze meats as soon as possible. 
*    Place meats at the bottom of the refrigerator or freezer so that they don’t leak onto other food items, especially ready to eat items. 
*    When thawing frozen meats, it’s a good idea to place them on something, like a plate or tray, so that they don’t leak on other things.  
*    It’s a good idea to cook meats promptly.  Once cooked, meats can be eaten or portioned out and put back into the refrigerator or freezer.  </code></pre>



<p>My chicken is almost done. It’s quite a lot so I plan to portion it out and freeze most of it. I hope these reminders help you. For more information on food safety, visit <a href="https://www.foodsafety.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.foodsafety.gov/</a>.</p>

<p>The weather is still warm everywhere except for a few places. Many places start back to school next week. It seems to me that this weekend would be a great time for a BBQ, or at least to grill something on a grill.</p>



<p>I had a discussion with a friend who said something couldn’t be called BBQ unless it had BBQ sauce. I don’t agree. What do you think?</p>



<p>Aside from that, there are several things that we can cook on a grill, whether we use gas or charcoal. Here are some of them:</p>



<p>Chicken: it can be bone in or boneless. It can be seasoned however we like, marinaded overnight or seasoned right before it is put on the grill. It can also be partially cooked before it is put on the grill. One of my favorites is putting hickory wood chips in with charcoals.</p>



<p>Hotdogs: you can use any kind of hotdog you like. And you can add just about anything you like to a hotdog, as long as it is chopped into tiny pieces. Chili and cheese is one of my favorites.</p>



<p>Hamburgers or Cheeseburgers: it’s a good idea to avoid over flipping burgers, as they tend to fall apart easily. I like mine on the rare side with mayo, tomato and catsup. You can also toast the bun if you like.</p>



<p>Steak: steak is a rare treat. Depending on the the cut, you may want to tenderize it with by pounding or using some sort of meat tenderizing marinade.</p>



<p>Fish: Fish can be pretty amazing cooked on a grill. It can be tender and flaky if not overcooked, and depending on what kind of fish it is. While most fish should not be overcooked, there are some that probably taste better being a little on the crunch side and might be better deep fried.</p>



<p>Shish-kabobs: a shish-kabob can be just about anything you want. A real shish-kabob probably means it has lamb or sheep meat, but it doesn’t have to. If you prefer, call it a kabob. Either way, you can use sausage, beef, shrimp or chicken. Onions and peppers are also popular. And, if you like, you can marinade them.</p>



<p>I don’t think there is ever a bad time to BBQ, given that the weather is suitable. What do you think? Do you have a favorite meat to BBQ? Please let me know in the comment. Thanks and have a great weekend.</p>

<p>Dear Diary,<br>The teaching at church was from Matthew 7. It was on how we should approach God in prayer: with boldness and with confidence. We can approach God with boldness because of what Jesus has done on our behalf and we can approach God with confidence because of who God is.</p>



<p>I managed to go for a walk this morning. Now, it’s too hot and I don’t really want to go anywhere. I just got back from church and had baby bok choy. I’m supposed to meet Colin for burgers for dinner.</p>



<p>I made it to the gym a few days last week. One day I had intended to go, I wound up coming home to unplug something that I had intended to unplug before leaving for work. Oops.</p>



<p>The Olympics are in full swing. I’m not sure who might have one something. It seems that there is a lot of hype when it comes to local businesses that doesn’t come to fruition.</p>



<p>Yesterday, I had baked salmon and cauliflower with sliced lemon on top. I seared both with avocado oil and butter on medium heat before putting them both — in a cast iron skillet — in to an oven, preheated to 35o degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes. It was so good, I could hardly wait for it to cool down before starting to eat it.</p>



<p>God, I pray that You would enter the hearts of man that the world could find the only source of peace, which is Your Son: Jesus Christ. Thank You for loving me. Thank You for Your Word, the Bible. Thank You for my friend, Lily.</p>



<p>In Jesus’ name,<br>Amen</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In general, this is what us up in the world of food, today. Prices are up and portions at least seem to be shrinking. It’s that good old inflation hard at work. It costs more to buy the food, so businesses are forced to either charge more for their product or make smaller portions. After all, less is healthier, right?</p>



<p>Yet, people are beginning to catch on, and several are standing up and saying that they don’t want smaller portions. What I think that the restaurants should do is to offer different serving sizes and price them accordingly. No, most people won’t like the higher prices, but at least it does offer options, ones that might not otherwise might not be available.</p>



<p>Many food restaurants already have various meal size options, from kid’s meals to full blown gut busters. Personally, when it comes to my fries, I usually get the small. Then I wonder why it costs nearly $2 for a hand full of fries.</p>



<p>There are a fair number of people who hold to the theory that more is better. And if that handful of fries is a bargain at $2, then what about doubling the portion size for just one more dollar?</p>



<p>As for me, I would rather eat a bowl of cereal at home than to spend $12 on a meal that I’ll probably take home to eat alone, anyway. If I had some company — someone to spend the time with — that would be a different story. For now, it’s just me.</p>



<p>What do you think? Would you rather have larger portions and higher prices or would you rather the prices stay the same and portions get smaller. Because the sad truth, for now, is that prices are going to increase; inflation is here to stay — at least for a while. And, if we want to be heard, we have to speak, up and to the right people. It does no good for me to complain to my neighbor about the price of tea in China.</p>



<p>Sometimes, it requires a letter to our congressman. Other times, we just need to get onto a businesses website and leave a comment. The choice is yours, and the choice is mine. Personally, I’m okay with the restaurants doing whatever they want. I’m staying home and cooking tonight.</p>

<p>As much as I enjoy writing, without you, it’s just me. And without your comments, I don’t know whether or not anyone is actually reading what I write.</p>



<p>In my last website, I had a lot of comments. And I had a lot of visitors. But I never knew if the visitors were actual people or just computer programs sent out to try to hack my website. And, with nearly all of the comments, there were links to porn. The rest of the links were to gambling.</p>



<p>What I want is real visits and comments by real people. That, I hope, is where you come in. I want, not to do this all by myself, but together with you. Maybe you can comment. Maybe you just let me know that you read what I wrote. Maybe you can drop me a note at LLGT Cafe, PO Box 2, Fayetteville, AR 72702. I would love to hear from you. And, if you write, I will do my best to write back.</p>



<p>You can also find me on Facebook at: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100086842894531">https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100086842894531</a></p>



<p>Now, July is National Hot Dog Month and there is still time left to celebrate. What does it take? It takes at least a hotdog and a hotdog bun, but that’s just the beginning. Here are a few things that you may want to add to your hotdog:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Pickle Relish</li>



<li>Mustard</li>



<li>Ketchup</li>



<li>Mayonnaise</li>



<li>Ranch Dressing</li>



<li>Horseradish Sauce</li>



<li>Salsa</li>



<li>Chili, for a chili dog</li>



<li>Cheese, shredded or melted</li>



<li>BBQ Sauce</li>
</ul>



<p>What ideas can you come up with? How do you cook your hot dog? Do you microwave it or grill it? I would like my hot dog with a baseball game and soda, please. Comment your ideas below and have a great National Hot Dog Month.</p>

<p>Dear Diary,<br>Happy Sunday. I’ve had my shower and there is time for a walk before church. Fortunately, for me I’m driving to church and don’t have to walk to get there. If I did, I would probably be late.</p>



<p>I’m ready for cooler weather. Yet, it’s still only July and there are at least another five weeks of just too hot before it starts to cool off.</p>



<p>It’s National Hamburger Day and my ground beef is thawed from being in the freezer. I should celebrate after church. I think I’ll call it lunch. It’s also National Milk Chocolate Day. I have some chocolates that I can use to celebrate that, too. Yum. Today is National Waterpark Day, but I would rather celebrate National Air-conditioner Day.</p>



<p>It’s bright enough to go for a walk.</p>



<p>Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. — Matthew 5:3 (KJV)</p>



<p>God,<br>You are holy, God.</p>



<p>Thank you for Today. Thank you for giving me a new day to love you and to love others as myself.</p>



<p>Thank you for giving me enough that I can share what I have with others. You lack nothing and you are kind enough to share what you have with me. God, You alone are good, kind and loving. Thank You for loving me so that I can love others.</p>



<p>Help me to hear what You would have me to hear at church.</p>



<p>Forgive me when I fail.<br>In Jesus’ name,<br>Amen</p>

<p>Time for lunch<br>Yes, it is<br>To get a drink<br>With a fizz</p>



<p>What would you<br>Like to eat<br>No, no<br>Don’t play with your feet</p>



<p>It’s time for lunch<br>So order now<br>Would you like a banana<br>Or milk from a cow</p>



<p>Okay, fries<br>A shake<br>A burger<br>No, no snake</p>



<p>Time to eat<br>And yes I will<br>Because you cannot<br>Pay the bill</p>



<p>And now<br>Back to the zoo<br>And just in case<br>You’re hungry too<br>I brought you my leftovers<br>Yes, it’s tofu</p>
