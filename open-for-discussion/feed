										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The power went out some time after 7:30 AM. I found out some time around 8 AM. It seems that the rain caused a tree limb to droop down low enough to hit a power line.</p>



<p>It’s an easy fix for the power company. But if I hadn’t seen the power company truck, I would not have known.</p>



<p>What if the power weren’t back on. What would I do if the power outage were more widespread? After a tornado hit neighboring towns a little over 2 years ago, the place where I work lost power for three days.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I have backup lights, and that’s a good place to start. But that’s only a start. I can’t make my instant coffee and, if the power were still out, I wouldn’t want to open my fridge.</p>



<p>So, what is it that I need if the power goes out for an extended time — say, a week or more?</p>



<p>Light<br>Light comes in handy. And, if you have light, it helps to see what you are doing. Along with that is the batteries to power that light.</p>



<p>Water<br>Water may be next, if the water fails to run. LifeStraws are also a good source of clean water. They filter water that is not drinkable and makes it drinkable.</p>



<p>Sheler<br>Assuming that there is no structural damage, as in an earthquake or tornado, some form of protection from the heat or cold may be needed. A battery powered fan may be useful. Extra blankets can also help; sleeping bags work, too.</p>



<p>Food<br>Canned goods may be important. Try to stick with things that you know that you will use, whether in an emergency or not. If you won’t eat it before it expires, you probably shouldn’t buy it.</p>



<p>Planning<br>This includes making plans of what to do if the power goes out. You may check to see if there is still radio. If there is, great. If not, wait. Phone service may or may not work. Check the weather to see if it is raining. You may also check to see if anyone else is without power. If they have power, it’s likely that the problem is in your home or apartment. If you know your neighbors, you may be able to help them with their needs.</p>



<p>Planning can help with a lot of issues in an emergency, such as a power outage. But it can’t solve every issue that might arise. I find that prayer goes a long way, too. In an emergency, teamwork goes much further. It’s a win-win situation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Do you want some good news? I think it’s good, tough you are welcome to disagree.</p>



<p>Deuteronomy 23: 35-36 (KJV) says, “To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste. For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.”</p>



<p>You know what this means? For me, it means I don’t need to judge others or worry about doing so. And, really, I have desire to judge others. It’s too hard to tell who is telling the truth and who is lying. It’s too hard to tell the motives for any given acton. It’s nearly impossible to walk in someone else’s shoes.</p>



<p>No, I don’t know way I do many of the things that I do. So how can I expect myself to be able to understand why others do the things that they do? Answer: I cannot.</p>



<p>Say, for example, I have two children. Say that the two get into a fight and, when confronted, each blames the other. It would be a mistake to choose one over the other, but that is the tendency. Instead, both should be equally punished. Right?</p>



<p>Perhaps, or perhaps not. Maybe the best thing to do would be to help the two to find a way to work it out: to mediate a deal between the two. Far above what punishment could do, this could be a true life lesson.</p>



<p>I don’t know about you, but I am all too quick to judge other’s motives or intent. And, when I do, it can have lasting and negative effects on me and on my relationships.</p>



<p>There is, however, one thing that we can do. We can be open with each other. If something bothers us, we can say, this thing that you are doing makes me uncomfortable. It hurts me when you…..</p>



<p>We should avoid saying things like, “You are a bad person,” and “I don’t like you.” These are things that probably aren’t true, or may be true for a short time. Really, “I don’t like you” is just a way of saying “I’m mad, or sad, or both.”</p>



<p>Instead of judging, I can listen. I can ask questions and try to figure out what went wrong. I can also offer possible solutions. If a fix to the problem is found, great. If not, it may take more time. If no solution is found, maybe one person or the other just don’t want to admit that he or she may be wrong. But, again, it’s not possible for me to know with 100% certainty. Only God knows, and only God can judge the heart.</p>



<p>“Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, ‘Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord’” — Romans 12:19 (KJV)</p>



<p>What do I take away from this? I can and should be more patient — with myself and with others. I don’t need to judge others or their motives. I don’t even really need to judge my own motives. Now, if I need help with a matter, I should find out the best person to talk to. If I need medical advise, I should talk to a doctor. If I need to know how to spell a work, I find that Google works well. If I’m part of a fight, I should realize that I am part of the problem. And when I come to this realization, I should stop, step back and ask, “What is the real problem?”</p>



<p>What do you think? I think that this is good news. But you are welcome to disagree.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>What’s going on in this world? It seems like a simple question. But in all honesty, I don’t really know. I only know about my very small part of this very large world. And what is going on with the rest of the world — it really depends on who you ask.</p>



<p>If you watch television, well, again, it depends on what you watch and on your perspective on what you see. If you watch the news, it will tend to shift your view of things in one direction or another. It may have you thinking that, well, I’m glad I’m no so-and-so. Or, it may have you believe that, if that person does (fill in the blank), it must be okay for me, too. Or you may believe the lies and half truths that many of the advertisements present.</p>



<p>On the other hand, you may see a television show and not have the perspective of those who usually watch such shows. For example, someone in another country could watch an American sitcom in another country and think that that is what Americans are like. Or I could watch a British sitcom and think that was what the British are like. But it would be inaccurate for me to think that.</p>



<p>You could stick to social media and think that the pictures and video present a complete and accurate picture of the world. They don’t. Or, worse, you could believe that porn sights and the images that they present offer show the reality of what relationships should look like. They certainly don’t. Unfortunately, it seems that many of us don’t even learn what relationships ought to look like in our own homes, and schools certainly don’t teach us.</p>



<p>Depending on what church you find yourself in, if you dare go, you may find a loving or a judging God. You may find someone who knows how to teach God’s Word, or you may find someone who just knows how to draw a crowd. You may find a church that God is using to build His kingdom, or you may find people who are busy building their own kingdom here on earth. I think I’m pretty fortunate to be in a church right now that is focused on Jesus and on His kingdom. It’s growing — not because of popular teaching like how to live your best life now — but because people need Jesus. We need to find hope, not only for this life, but the promise of eternal life that only Jesus can bring.</p>



<p>What’s going on in this world? Honestly, all I can say is that those who are running from God will keep running from God until, or unless, in running from Him, they eventually run into Him. Those who seek God — and not gods, with a little “g” — will likely keep growing closer to God.</p>



<p>Are things going to get better or worse? Are things going to stay the same? I don’t know the answer to that. It depends who you — or I — listen to.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Something caught my attention on the way home from church the other day. I don’t think I noticed it on the way to church because I was in a bit of a hurry. It was a building, or lack of one, where one of the restaurants from my past had once stood. I don’t drive that way often, and it was kind of a surprise to see that it had been torn down and lay in a heap of rubble. Actually, there were two buildings side by side, and I can’t really say I remember much about the other building.</p>



<p>Whether we like it or not, we all face change. We grow older, move, find and loose friendships and so on. Change is easier for some of us and harder for others. But that can change, too. Someone who easily accepts change can find change more difficult in times of stress. And, though we may be the ones initiating a change, more often, it is “forced” upon us.</p>



<p>I cay forced in quotes because we always have a choice. We may not like the choices that we have but that doesn’t negate that we have the ability to choose. One job that I had changes that came on a regular basis. Now, I could have refused to abide by these changes and I probably would have been let go. Or, I could have found another job. But I’m usually okay with change, so I stayed, until other circumstances changed.</p>



<p>Whether change is good or bad depends on how we perceive it. And even our perception of a particular event can change over time. We have the ability to choose how we see things. James 1:2-3 tells us that we can rejoice when we find ourselves in hard times because it’s the hard times that produce strength and character in us. No, I don’t enjoy hard times, but I am aware that rain brings flowers; the flow of water and wind can bring new beauty to landscapes.</p>



<p>Whether I find myself facing a change, in the midst of change or trying to deal with change that has already occurred, I find the best thing to do is pray. I can pray that God will help me though the situation. Some times, I find myself fearing change that may or may not happen and so I remind myself of verses like Philippians 4:6 that tells us that we shouldn’t worry but should pray, instead.</p>



<p>Probably the worst thing that we can do is to give up. We may surrender a situation to God, but that doesn’t mean that we give up our responsibility to deal with the change that we face. And suicide is never the answer. Usually, the problems will go away. But even if they won’t, we can find joy in the midst of our pain. We can adapt and overcome.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’ve been a Christian for just over 40 years, now. I’ve lived in several different places, gone to several different churches, and heard a lot of different people speak on what they believe is the truth. Believe me, no one says “this is what I’m teaching, but I don’t really believe it.”</p>



<p>Below are some of the things that I’ve heard over the years. See if any of these seem familiar.</p>



<p><strong>The Bible</strong><br>The Bible is the inerrant Word of God. The Bible is just a collection of good stores. Every word of the Bible is true. There are mistakes and embellishments. Jesus spoke in perfect King James. Only those who know Greek and Hebrew can fully understand the Bible. The King James Bible is the best and only Bible that we should use. It’s best to use multiple translations. We need to follow the whole law. We just need to follow two laws (love God and love others as ourselves). The Holy Spirit gave men the words to write. Men used their own stories to create God over time. Shakespeare wrote some of the Psalms. We can use the Bible to predict the future. We can only look back and use the Bible to know that what God said was true.</p>



<p><strong>Creation</strong><br>God created the heavens in the earth. The universe was created in an explosion. God created man in his image. Man evolved over millions of years, starting in a pool of water or something like that. Creation took seven days. Creation got started and was interrupted by some destructive event. God created all things but used evolution in the process. Evolution is real. Evolution is not. The earth is about 6,000 years old. The earth is millions of years old. God created man. Man created God.</p>



<p><strong>Johan</strong><br>The story of Jonah, along with other similar stories, is real. The story was made up. Job existed. Job is just a good story.</p>



<p><strong>Jesus</strong><br>Jesus is God and a part of the trinity. Jesus was a good teacher and nothing more. Jesus never sinned.Jesus sinned. Jesus claimed to be equal with God.  Jesus never claimed equality with God. Jesus’ death allows us to have eternal life. Jesus’ disciples stole the body of Jesus and he is still dead. The stories of Jesus are real and factual. The stories of Jesus were made up and just got better and better over time. Jesus said this. Jesus meant that. Jesus didn’t exist because there is no “J” in Hebrew. Jesus is the way. Jesus is a way.</p>



<p><strong>Baptism</strong><br>Baptism should be done as early as possible. Baptism should be done only after there is faith and salvation. Baptism is essential to salvation. Baptism is only symbolic of what has taken place in one’s life. Baptism alone saves. Baptism is done by sprinkling. Baptism is by immersion. Baptism is in the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. Baptism is in the name of Jesus. There is one baptism. There is a separate baptism in the Holy Spirit.</p>



<p><strong>Spiritual gifts</strong><br>Spiritual gifts still exist. Spiritual gifts ceased a long time ago. Speaking in tongues is made up. Speaking in tongues is the sign of spiritual life. Tongues is a gift that allows people to speak in other languages, even the tongues of angels. Tongues was only used on Pentecost so that the foreigners could understand what was said in their own language. Gifts are only the well known gifts, such as tongues and healing. The gifts include serving and teaching. People poses spiritual gifts. Only God can heal.</p>



<p><strong>Salvation</strong><br>Salvation is trough faith in Jesus Christ. Salvation is through faith and works. Salvation is through works. We can know that we have eternal life. We can only hope that we have eternal life. Man goes to God. God goes to man. Man chooses. God chooses. There will be millions in heaven. There will only be about 144,000. Whosoever believes can have eternal life. Only those whom God chooses can have eternal life. Salvation is something that God already has given us from birth. Salvation is something that we receive when we believe. Salvation is something that we cannot loose. Salvation is something that we can loose at any time. Salvation depends on what we do. Our salvation depends only on whether or not we choose to believe. God chooses to give salvation to some but rejects others. The old testament was different. Those who lived in old testament times also received eternal life through faith. Jews need Jesus, just like anyone else. God has a different plan for the Jew.  All dogs go to heaven.  No dogs go to heaven. </p>



<p><strong>End times</strong><br>We are in end times. There could be another 100 years or more to go. There are still prophecies to be fulfilled. Prophecy has already been fulfilled. There will be a rapture before, during or after a seven year tribulation. There will be no rapture. Jesus will rule and reign on earth for a thousand years. There will be no thousand year reign. God will judge the earth. A messiah will come to save the earth. Jesus will come, admit that he never died on the cross and give his power to Mohamed before killing all who refuse to worship him. The tribulations is a seven year period. The tribulation is more like a time lasting 144 years.</p>



<p>If you haven’t guess, I don’t believe all of these things, and this is certainly not a complete list. We all have our own beliefs, believing either the things that we were taught or drawing conclusions of our own along the way.</p>



<p>Personally, I choose to keep my mind open in a lot of areas. In the end, does it matter what I believe? When I stand before God, will he ask me if I spoke in tongues or healed anyone. Will God ask me whether or not I believe that Johan was a real man. Will God ask me which Bible translation I read, or sigh in relief when I say that I prefer the King James translation. I seriously doubt it. What does matter? You know, I’m not going to answer that. You have to decide for yourself.</p>

<p>I needed a bag to take my lunch to work this morning, and I was in a hurry, so I dumbed the contents of the first bag that I came to on the floor. Unfortunately, along with everything else, I wound up dumping about a quarter cup of stevia or some other sugar substitute onto the carpet.</p>



<p>I don’t own a vacuum cleaner, or I didn’t at the time, and I really didn’t want to leave this mess on the floor overnight.</p>



<p>Fear is the absence of faith that things will be okay, worrying that things won’t go as one might hope or that things will not happen as quickly as we need. Depression is the feeling that things will never get better. The Bible tells us that perfect love casts out fear. Yet, love and faith are not the same thing.</p>



<p>Hebrews 11:1 (KJV) tells us, <strong>“Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” Hebrews 11:6 goes on to say, “ But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.”</strong></p>



<p>it seems that I’m always waiting for something. Most of the time things turn out just fine, but there always seems to be just a little doubt that the next thing will turn out okay. If not, there is the concern that I might do the wrong thing.</p>



<p>Whether we realize it or not, all of us have faith. We have faith that, when we go to bed at night that we will wake up, we have faith that we will make it wherever we are going safely. We have faith that this day will be much like the days before. We “practice” our faith by though prayer or by study, and we live our faith by doing good for others. And we display our faith through our conversation.</p>



<p>The problem that I have is that, as 2 Corinthians 5:7 states, we are to walk by faith and not by sight. That’s fine when things are going well. It’s a lot harder when you get laid off, or when you don’t know where the money is going to come from just to meet basic needs, and things don’t look like they’ll get better for months. In spite of all that times that God has provided for my needs, there still looms that feeling that, maybe this time, he may not.</p>



<p>Faith is like a muscle in that it gets stronger with use. Yes, I prefer the times when I don’t need as much faith but in order to exercise faith, at least a little bit of stress and tension are required. No one builds their faith by having it easy as no one builds muscle by reclining in an easy chair.</p>



<p>Do I look for ways to make things better? Yes. But to some extent, I have to realize that everything belongs to God, and that he is more than capable of taking care of all of my needs. Is it hard some times? Yes. The good news is that, like everything that we work at, with time, it does get easier.</p>

<p>Probably some of the best advise I’ve ever not followed is to start saving money. It seems that there’s always a “need” or a want. The few times that I did have some amount of money, I usually wasn’t working, so that money didn’t last long.</p>



<p>The reality is, most if not all of us are going to have to borrow from ourselves at one time or another. We can either have that money in the bank or in some sort of investment, or we can use credit and borrow from our future selves.</p>



<p>One of the problems that I had when I was told that I needed to start saving was that I didn’t really have any clear goals at the time. Even after graduating from culinary school, with nearly $30 thousand in student loans, I didn’t really have a clear understanding of what I wanted to do.</p>



<p>When you’re younger, it’s easy to dismiss the thought of growing older. And the thought of retirement can seem like a strange concept. But, like many other things that we can do, saving can become a habit. And whether we save a little or a lot, saving is a good habit to have because it’s more about forming the habit than how much money we are able to set aside: at least at first.</p>



<p>Money can only make us so happy, though it can give us a certain comfort level. The law of diminishing returns states that, in the case of money, have money only helps make us happier to a certain point. I think it’s somewhere around $75 thousand a year that the plateau starts to flatten out.</p>



<p>It’s hard to say how things might have been had I made different choices along the way. I, probably like many others, keep hoping that “my ship will come in” or that things might somehow change. In my case, things did change. I got laid off from a job where I was a temp for nearly 18 months, wound up getting another temp job with a $2 an hour raise, lost that after a week and a half. Now, I’m working a job that is $1.50 less than I made for those 18 months.</p>



<p>I don’t share these stories because I did everything right but because I’ve failed countless times. Some times I learn something from my failures. It’s the lessons that I’ve learned that I hope will help you.</p>
