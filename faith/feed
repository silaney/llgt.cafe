<p>Dear Diary,<br>This was today’s Bible verse: “Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence.” — Isaiah 64:1 (KJV)</p>



<p>To rend is to tear, but with a sense of urgency. It’s as if to say, “God, we need you now.” I find that, these days, I never stop needing God. I need him all of the time, whether I am conscious of my need or not.</p>



<p>Today is Never Give Up Day. It is a worldwide holiday aimed at helping individuals who are suffering from various forms of pain and grief. It is meant as an encouragement us to not give up and keep on going.</p>



<p>Today is also National Fajita Day as well as National Ice Cream Pie Day. And if I had known about either one of these in advance, I might have been better prepared to celebrate. Maybe next year.</p>



<p>Lord,<br>Help me to not give up, but to do it because I know that you are with me.</p>



<p>Help those who have suffered loss. Be with them and encourage them as they face yet another day with whatever it is they are suffering. Thank you that, as long as we are alive, you never give up on us.</p>



<p>May ever day be a day to celebrate because of what Jesus has done on the cross: redeeming me and giving me a future that is better and brighter that I can ever imagine. Thank you.</p>



<p>In Jesus’ name,<br>Amen</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There is a saying that hard times can either make us better or bitter. That is, the difficulties that we face can make us stronger in character or make us angry and, perhaps, make us more isolated.</p>



<p>There is another side to that. Hard times can either draw us to God or away from God. Whether we realize it or not, we are always moving in one direction or another: towards God or away from Him. And we either have a relationship with God or we don’t.</p>



<p>The good news, the Gospel, tells us that it’s easy to begin a relationship with God. John 3:16 tells us, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</p>



<p>It seems that everyone has difficulties at times, whether we believe in God or not, whether we have a relationship with God or not. Hard times are, it seems, just a part of life.</p>



<p>I was fourteen when I began my relationship with the living God thought Jesus Christ and what he did and who he is: born of a virgin, lived a perfect life, died on a cross, a ransom for my sins, and rose again. Jesus us as much God as the Father and the Holy Spirit: three in one. It’s not something I can fully, 100% understand, but I’m okay with that.</p>



<p>Some times, I look at the news, and I don’t understand the things that others are going through. The killing and such just seems beyond my comprehension. Wars just never seem to end and, when one does, there is another one around the corner. But for those who believe, for those who have a relationship with the living God, there is this promise: “And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.” — Romans 8:28 (KJV)</p>



<p>I have to admit that it took me many years to figure out how some of the events that took place in my life could work for my good, but I’ve begun to figure it out. Either that, or I’ve just decided to accept it by faith.</p>



<p>Which way are you headed, towards God or away from him? Do you have a relationship with God. If so, God’s Word promises that no one and nothing can take you away from him. I’m counting on that, because I’m still nowhere near perfect. But I am moving closer to God. And hopefully each day, with the help of the Holy Spirit, I’m becoming more and more like Jesus.</p>

<p>Dear Diary,<br>The teaching at church was from Matthew 7. It was on how we should approach God in prayer: with boldness and with confidence. We can approach God with boldness because of what Jesus has done on our behalf and we can approach God with confidence because of who God is.</p>



<p>I managed to go for a walk this morning. Now, it’s too hot and I don’t really want to go anywhere. I just got back from church and had baby bok choy. I’m supposed to meet Colin for burgers for dinner.</p>



<p>I made it to the gym a few days last week. One day I had intended to go, I wound up coming home to unplug something that I had intended to unplug before leaving for work. Oops.</p>



<p>The Olympics are in full swing. I’m not sure who might have one something. It seems that there is a lot of hype when it comes to local businesses that doesn’t come to fruition.</p>



<p>Yesterday, I had baked salmon and cauliflower with sliced lemon on top. I seared both with avocado oil and butter on medium heat before putting them both — in a cast iron skillet — in to an oven, preheated to 35o degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes. It was so good, I could hardly wait for it to cool down before starting to eat it.</p>



<p>God, I pray that You would enter the hearts of man that the world could find the only source of peace, which is Your Son: Jesus Christ. Thank You for loving me. Thank You for Your Word, the Bible. Thank You for my friend, Lily.</p>



<p>In Jesus’ name,<br>Amen</p>

<p>Dear Diary,<br>Happy Sunday. I’ve had my shower and there is time for a walk before church. Fortunately, for me I’m driving to church and don’t have to walk to get there. If I did, I would probably be late.</p>



<p>I’m ready for cooler weather. Yet, it’s still only July and there are at least another five weeks of just too hot before it starts to cool off.</p>



<p>It’s National Hamburger Day and my ground beef is thawed from being in the freezer. I should celebrate after church. I think I’ll call it lunch. It’s also National Milk Chocolate Day. I have some chocolates that I can use to celebrate that, too. Yum. Today is National Waterpark Day, but I would rather celebrate National Air-conditioner Day.</p>



<p>It’s bright enough to go for a walk.</p>



<p>Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. — Matthew 5:3 (KJV)</p>



<p>God,<br>You are holy, God.</p>



<p>Thank you for Today. Thank you for giving me a new day to love you and to love others as myself.</p>



<p>Thank you for giving me enough that I can share what I have with others. You lack nothing and you are kind enough to share what you have with me. God, You alone are good, kind and loving. Thank You for loving me so that I can love others.</p>



<p>Help me to hear what You would have me to hear at church.</p>



<p>Forgive me when I fail.<br>In Jesus’ name,<br>Amen</p>

<p>It’s a new day<br>One for which<br>I did not pay</p>



<p>It’s new to me<br>And new to you<br>what will we see<br>and what will we do</p>



<p>I do not know<br>Will I shrink<br>or will I grow<br>Shrink in fear<br>Or grow in knowledge</p>



<p>Will I be better today<br>Than I was yesterday<br>Or will I stay the same<br>Or grow in fame<br>Will I die to self<br>And learn to live<br>Will I keep<br>Or choose to give</p>



<p>Who knows<br>What the day will bring<br>Will it be different<br>Or the same<br>Is life a burden<br>Or is it a game<br>I give you my time<br>I sell it for a dime</p>



<p>Is it over now<br>Or just getting started<br>Will I glow bright<br>Or flame be retarded<br>Will I be a start<br>Shine from afar<br>Can you see my light</p>



<p>Can you see me fight<br>To resist myself<br>To lay in bed<br>And lay my head<br>And close my eyes<br>Or go instead</p>



<p>To go out<br>And change my world<br>To change myself<br>To be the same<br>Or build a shelf</p>



<p>To do something<br>For someone else<br>Of for myself<br>With someone else</p>



<p>To be alone<br>Or be with you<br>In mine own zoo</p>



<p>&nbsp;It is of the Lord&#8217;s mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness. The Lord is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. Lamentations 3:22-24 (KJV)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today is Perfect Family Day. So, what does that mean? Guess what, I don’t think that such a thing exists. It’s kind of like the unicorn, or Bigfoot. Maybe someone has seen it. Maybe someone has even captured a picture of it. But it seems to only exist in the minds of individuals. I’ll get back to that, later.</p>



<p>All of us are too imperfect to, as a family unit, make up a perfect family. We make mistakes, we hurt one another, we say and do things that we know deep down that we shouldn’t. We intentionally or unintentionally do things that hurt the ones that we love the most. How can we, let along a family, be perfect?</p>



<p>Look at it this way. A puzzle isn’t made of square pieces, Each one has a unique image and shape so that it will fit in a precise place. An edge piece does not go in the middle of the puzzle, nor does a piece from the middle go on the edge. Mistakes don’t make us imperfect. And, when we hurt someone we love, when we realize what we’ve done, we can apologize. And we can try to not do the same thing, again.</p>



<p>Seeing it another way, a rare steak may be perfect for me but not for you. Salad may be my perfect dinner, or it may be a burger. Your perfect dinner may be soup and a grill cheese. The thing is, we are all unique.</p>



<p>Unlike the puzzle, God can put us together in ways that don’t fit at first. He may put us a marriage with someone we feel attracted to and, later, seems not to suit us. Yet, God sees marriage as a binding contract — until death. And that doesn’t mean until one or the other feels as if she is dying.</p>



<p>Part of building a relationship is to realize that we don’t always get our way and being okay with that. Another part is having the willingness to let God shape us into the man or woman whom God wants us to be. It really is simple: love God, love others as ourselves. The hard part may be that I may not believe that God can love me. After all, I’m so imperfect. And, not realizing how much God does love me, I cannot fully love God and others.</p>



<p>Another thing is that, if I disrespect God or his creation, I cannot fully love either. Lust, envy and spreading rumors or lies can all distort our views of others and hurt our relationship with a loving God. For a relationship is built from love and love comes from the hormones? No, it comes from the heart. But so does hate and jealousy: so, watch out for these things.</p>



<p>There is evidence that the heart is part of the nervous system that can contain memories. Aside from that, there is muscle memory. Whether memories exist outside of the brain is not what matters. What matters is that love comes from every bit of our being. It comes in the warm embrace as well as the kind deed. It comes from seeing a mistake as an attempt to learn and not as something to be avoided all together.</p>



<p>So, who is it that puts me into the relationship where I find myself? I believe that God does. Who decides when it is time to move on? Again, I believe that God does. Yet, all too often, I believe that I can take that role from God and put it on myself. Maybe you have done that too. Maybe it’s not too late to recognize our mistakes and to make reconciliation: to restore relationships once lost.</p>



<p>Is there such a thing as a perfect family? From our vantage point, probably not. But I can’t see what God sees. And that is what truly matters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The power went out some time after 7:30 AM. I found out some time around 8 AM. It seems that the rain caused a tree limb to droop down low enough to hit a power line.</p>



<p>It’s an easy fix for the power company. But if I hadn’t seen the power company truck, I would not have known.</p>



<p>What if the power weren’t back on. What would I do if the power outage were more widespread? After a tornado hit neighboring towns a little over 2 years ago, the place where I work lost power for three days.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I have backup lights, and that’s a good place to start. But that’s only a start. I can’t make my instant coffee and, if the power were still out, I wouldn’t want to open my fridge.</p>



<p>So, what is it that I need if the power goes out for an extended time — say, a week or more?</p>



<p>Light<br>Light comes in handy. And, if you have light, it helps to see what you are doing. Along with that is the batteries to power that light.</p>



<p>Water<br>Water may be next, if the water fails to run. LifeStraws are also a good source of clean water. They filter water that is not drinkable and makes it drinkable.</p>



<p>Sheler<br>Assuming that there is no structural damage, as in an earthquake or tornado, some form of protection from the heat or cold may be needed. A battery powered fan may be useful. Extra blankets can also help; sleeping bags work, too.</p>



<p>Food<br>Canned goods may be important. Try to stick with things that you know that you will use, whether in an emergency or not. If you won’t eat it before it expires, you probably shouldn’t buy it.</p>



<p>Planning<br>This includes making plans of what to do if the power goes out. You may check to see if there is still radio. If there is, great. If not, wait. Phone service may or may not work. Check the weather to see if it is raining. You may also check to see if anyone else is without power. If they have power, it’s likely that the problem is in your home or apartment. If you know your neighbors, you may be able to help them with their needs.</p>



<p>Planning can help with a lot of issues in an emergency, such as a power outage. But it can’t solve every issue that might arise. I find that prayer goes a long way, too. In an emergency, teamwork goes much further. It’s a win-win situation.</p>

<p>As God crafted us<br>With His own hands<br>Dirt and clay<br>And likely sands<br>He walked with us<br>And talked with us<br>And our fall hurt Him<br>More than us</p>



<p>When God was born<br>He lived and sighed<br>He bled<br>And died<br>He rose<br>To rome<br>To one day<br>Take us home</p>



<p>Whether<br>With out without<br>I am not alone<br>Now<br>I am clean<br>In His sight</p>



<p>If God could create the world<br>By Day six<br>And choose to die<br>On two sticks<br>That he made<br>What can be said<br>How can be sad<br>God loves me<br>He sent his Son</p>
