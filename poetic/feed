<p>Yesterday I woke up early<br>I wrote the post for my blog and<br>After stopping at the store<br>For breakfast I went to church to<br>Help with parking</p>



<p>At the church, I saw<br>A young lady who<br>Seemed unsure of herself and<br>Her reason for being there, so<br>I walked over to a table where<br>Pastries lay. I picked one up, walked over and handed<br>It to the young lady. She smiled and so did I. Maybe<br>I was able to help her<br>In some way to<br>Feel more comfortable</p>



<p>Yesterday, I talked to a woman about her old home in<br>Colorado and her new church family in Arkansas.<br>It was cold out and her son didn’t yet want<br>To get into the car. I showed him my flashlight and<br>Told him that he could have it if he got in his mom’s car.<br>Maybe, I helped her, too</p>



<p>Yesterday, I started writing my book<br>I wrote until I could write no more<br>Then I took a nap<br>Then I called my friend and<br>Wrote more</p>



<p>Today, I put the finishing touches<br>On my book. I printed<br>It</p>



<p>What now? I’m not<br>Sure. I guess we will have<br>To find out together</p>
