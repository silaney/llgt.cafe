<p>Judy: What kind of jobs do most dogs work?<br>Frank: I don’t know, what kind of jobs do most dogs work?<br>Judy: Roofing.</p>



<p>Today is National Bowling Day. And though I haven’t been bowling in many years, I have enjoyed bowling in the past.</p>



<p>It seems to me if you are a pro-bowler, then every day is a good day to bowl. If you are like me, you have to wait for someone to invite you to go bowling. Maybe you are somewhere in between and you go bowling a few times a year.</p>



<p>I think that the last time I bowled was at least five years ago and was related to a company party.</p>



<p>If you are one of those in the middle, consider inviting others to go bowling with you. If you have family, invite them. Bowling can be a lot of fun. Let me know what you think in the comments below. Thanks and have a great National Bowling Day, whatever you choose to do.</p>

<p>If humor is good medicine, don’t forget to take yours. Here are some jokes you might enjoy. Remember, be kind. I’m going to try to make these up on my own.</p>



<p>Judy: “You can’t sit here, this seat is saved.”<br>Frank: “Good, I’ve been praying for it.”</p>



<p>Judy: “Can you help me change this lightbulb?”<br>Frank: “Lord, we ask that You would help this bulb change.”</p>



<p>Judy: “Do you think God has a sense of humor?”<br>Frank: “He made me, didn’t he?”</p>



<p>Judy: “Have you seen the weather forecast?”<br>Frank: “It’s going to be rainy HOT.”<br>Judy: “Rainy HOT?”<br>Frank: “Yes, it’s going to be raining here or there.”</p>



<p>Frank: “Did you hear about the dog that walked twelve miles to visit his Pa and Grandpa?”<br>Judy: “No, tell me more.”<br>Frank: “When he got there, his Pas were tired.”</p>



<p>Judy: “How did your trip to Germany go?”<br>Frank: “It went well. But one day, I was out and I heard music playing; it seemed to be playing backwards.”<br>Judy: “Backwards?”<br>Frank: “Yes, so I followed it.”<br>Judy: “Where did it lead?”<br>Frank: “It led me to a cemetery, where I found the ghost of Beethoven.”<br>Judy: “What did he say.”<br>Frank: “Don’t bother me, I’m decomposing.”</p>



<p>Frank: “Knock-knock.”<br>Judy: “Who’s there?”<br>Frank: “Bacon.”<br>Judy: “Bacon, who?”<br>Frank: “Seriously, Judy, bacon is no joke.”</p>



<p>I hope at least one of these made you smile. If you have your own jokes — remember to keep them clean — please comment below and have a great weekend.</p>

<p>“<strong>Children are an heritage of the Lord” — Psalm 127:3</strong></p>



<p>Happy Aunt and Uncles Day. So, if my sister has a son, that makes me an uncle. If, instead, she has a daughter, does that make me an aunt? Just kidding.</p>



<p>If you happen to make it to Spokane, Washington, there is an amazing bookstore called Aunties. You should go if you have a chance.</p>



<p>If you have a niece for nephew, don’t bother trying to get them to mow the lawn with you. It may work but probably won’t. Instead, take them out to eat or to a movie of their choosing. You may want to read to him or her. Just have fun together.</p>

<p>“What did you learn in school, today,” Chris asked his two children, Julia and Daniel.</p>



<p>“We learned about blue green algae,” answered Julia, rather excitedly.</p>



<p>“You mean koombiotic relationships,” Chris asked.</p>



<p>“I think it’s symbiotic, dear,” said Charlotte.</p>



<p>“Oh, yes,” said Chris.</p>



<p>“We learned about eccentric circles,” said Daniel.</p>



<p>“I think you mean…” Charlotte paused. “Never mind.</p>



<p>“What do you have planned for this weekend,” Charlotte asked Chris.</p>



<p>“Well, the school has a football game, tonight. Chris continued, “It’s homecoming, and I’m the queen.”</p>



<p>“You men you’re in charge of the band,” asked Charlotte?</p>



<p>“Right,” said Chris. “And someone has to give away the bride.”</p>



<p>“What do you two have planned for the weekend,” asked Charlotte.</p>



<p>“We’re going to the game,” said Julia and Daniel. “We want to see Dad dressed up like the homecoming queen.”</p>



<p>“He is not dressing up as homecoming queen,” said Charlotte.</p>



<p>Just then, Caff entered the living room.</p>



<p>“Did I hear something about a homecoming queen,” asked Caff,</p>



<p>“It’s going to be a late night for Chris,” said Charlotte. “He has to stay up late for the homecoming game, and then he has to grade papers before next Monday.</p>



<p>“It sounds like he’s going to need some caffeine,” said Caff.</p>



<p>“Noooooo……,” said Chris, rather shocked and alarmed at what he had just heard.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong,” asked Charlotte, as Chris sat up in bed, awoken from a deep sleep.</p>



<p>“Oh, it was horrible,” said Chris. Daniel and I were making all sorts of grammatical errors, and I thought I was going to be homecoming queen.”</p>



<p>“It’s okay,” said Charlotte. “It was only a dream.”</p>



<p>“What’s that,” asked Chris?</p>



<p>“Oh,” replied Charlotte, “it’s a cup of coffee. Caff brought it by for the homecoming game tomorrow night. Remember, you’re homecoming queen.”</p>



<p>“Noooooo…..”</p>

<p>Family all arrived for the wedding of Chris and Charlotte. It was a small wedding in a small chapel on the north side of town. It was a beautiful wedding, and even Caff (short for Caffeine) attended.</p>



<p>The two moved into Chris’ home. Ten months later, Julia was born, weighing in at 6 pounds, nine ounces. And two years after that, Daniel was born, weighing it at 6 pounds, eight ounces. Then there were four.</p>



<p>Chris continued teaching, but put his crime fighting on hold, until… One evening, on his way home from the work, Chris noticed a man standing outside the bank. He looked suspicious, so Chris watched and waited.</p>



<p>Chris started with a song, humming at first, gradually getting louder, Before he knew it, the man was asleep. Just then, two men rushed out of the bank, finding their friend, sound asleep. It seemed that the man who was supposed to drive the get away car was sound asleep.</p>



<p>Chris continued his song and, soon, all three men were sound asleep. Soon, the police were on the scene, and all three men were taken into custody. But the question remained, who had stopped these men? Who was this hero who saved the day. Only we know the truth. Yes, it was Nap Man.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It was a rainy day in Tulsa, but Chris was determined to get to the newest exhibit at the Tulsa Historical Society &amp; Museum. Chris closed his umbrella, showed his bus pass to the driver, and found a seat near the back of the bus. It was still early, so Chris closed his eyes in an attempt to take a nap.</p>



<p>Within a few stops, the bus was nearly full. A young lady boarded the bus at the next stop and, looking for a seat, sat by Chris. She was about Chris’ age, and had a lovely smile. Chris looked up and said “hi.”, but the conversation went no further.</p>



<p>At Chris’ stop both he and the young lady that he had sat by got off the bus. It was still raining, and Chris offered to let her share his umbrella. The two entered the museum, and began looking around. It wasn’t long before the two bombed into each other, again, and Chris introduced himself.</p>



<p>“Hi, I’m Chris,” he said. “We shared my umbrella, earlier.”</p>



<p>“I’m Charlotte,” said the young lady, brushing back her long, dark brown hair.</p>



<p>The two continued exploring the paintings of the museum, and the two began walking, together.</p>



<p>“I was thinking about getting a bite to eat,” said Chris, “would you like to join me.”</p>



<p>“Sure,” said Charlotte, “I’m kind of hungry. There’s a nice little sandwich shop next to my apartment,” Charlotte continued.</p>



<p>“Sounds great,” said Chris.</p>



<p>The two left the museum, talking as they waited for the bus. It wasn’t long before the rain stopped, and the sun came out. The bus arrived, and the two found a seat near the back of the bus.</p>



<p>At the sandwich shop, the two ordered turkey and Swiss on rye, and Chris ordered extra tomato. Chris and Charlotte found a seat at a table outside, and continued talking. Chris couldn’t help but gaze into Charlotte’s deep brown eyes.</p>



<p>The two finished their lunch, and exchanged phone numbers.</p>



<p>“I had a good time, Chris,” said Charlotte.</p>



<p>“Me, too,” said Chris. “Maybe we can plan on meeting at the museum next weekend.”</p>



<p>“Sounds great,” said Charlotte.</p>



<p>Charlotte and Chris said goodbye and Charlotte headed off to her apartment.</p>



<p>Was it love at first sight? (to be continued)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Below is a list of unreal jobs. Yes, they are completely made up. I got the idea for a couple of them from outside sources, but made the rest of them up myself.</p>



<p><strong>Dropped call sweep</strong><br>Will be part of a team responsible for cleaning up all dropped called within the city of Spokane. No one wants to see those unsightly dropped calls and, over time, they can build up. Tools will be provided, though employees will need their own transportation.
