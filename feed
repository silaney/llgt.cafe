<p>Sometimes it’s nice to do something unexpected, for yourself or someone else. If you want to do something by yourself or with or for someone else, here are some ideas.</p>



<p>Go shopping, even if it’s just window shopping. It can be nice to just get out of the place you are at.</p>



<p>Take can unexpected trip. You can plan it ahead, throw a dart at a map or just go where the wind takes you. It can be a lot of fun to go somewhere that you’ve never been before.</p>



<p>Build something. Look around and find out what you have to work with and make something. It could be paper mache or wood. You could build something, carve something or decorate something.</p>



<p>Find a game to play, indoors or out. There’s everything form tic-tac-toe to horseshoes and it’s your choice.</p>



<p>Go out to eat or fix a fancy dinner. This may require a little more preparation depending on what you decide to do, but the result could be well worth it. If it is an option, enlist someone to help you.</p>



<p>Maybe one of these caught your attention. Or, perhaps you came up with your own idea. If so, please comment below.</p>

<p>Today is National Cuban Sandwich Day. It is observed annually on August 23. Apparently, started as “fake news,” National Cuban Sandwich Day later became a real holiday, celebrating the Cuban sandwich, which was first made some time around 1870 or 1880. It is a traditional sandwich of Cuba and made its way to the the US by way of southern Florida.</p>



<p>Though there are many variations, the traditional Cuban sandwich is made using Cuban bread, ham or pork, cheese and pickles. The bread is coated with a thin layer of oil and it hot pressed.</p>



<p>There are numerous recipes online, if you want to make your own, of you can see if a local sandwich shop makes them. The sandwiches themselves range from simple to gourmet.</p>



<p>Today is also Buttered Corn Day, which is also observed each year on August 23. If you have corn on the cob or can get some, after cooking it, or perhaps as part of the cooking process, make sure to add butter. Maybe you can have some corn with your Cuban sandwich.</p>



<p>Finally, today is National Sponge Cake Day. Sponge cake can be served alone or with toppings. You may be able to purchase some from a local bakery or you can find a recipe online. Either way, it would make an excellent dessert.</p>

<p>Someone gave me a bag of chicken pars and it was a reminder that I needed to do certain things to keep myself safe. The chicken was frozen, but the bag was open, so I tied it before putting it into the refrigerator to thaw. I’m cooking it, now.</p>



<p>There are some general tips to keep in mind when safely handling meats that can help keep you and others from getting sick.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>*    Refrigerate or or freeze meats as soon as possible. 
*    Place meats at the bottom of the refrigerator or freezer so that they don’t leak onto other food items, especially ready to eat items. 
*    When thawing frozen meats, it’s a good idea to place them on something, like a plate or tray, so that they don’t leak on other things.  
*    It’s a good idea to cook meats promptly.  Once cooked, meats can be eaten or portioned out and put back into the refrigerator or freezer.  </code></pre>



<p>My chicken is almost done. It’s quite a lot so I plan to portion it out and freeze most of it. I hope these reminders help you. For more information on food safety, visit <a href="https://www.foodsafety.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.foodsafety.gov/</a>.</p>

<p>Money, money<br>You’re so funny<br>You hop away<br>Like a bunny</p>

<p>Today is World Photo Day, which has been observed annually since 2010. The world’s first photograph was taken with a camera in 1826 by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce. Today, photographers are encouraged to share at least one photo on social media in honor of World Photo Day. It is to be a photo that depicts their world.</p>



<p>Below are some of my favorite pictures that I’ve taken over the years. I hope you enjoy them and remember to share your photos as well. Have a happy World Photo Day.</p>

<p>Dear Diary,<br>This was today’s Bible verse: “Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence.” — Isaiah 64:1 (KJV)</p>



<p>To rend is to tear, but with a sense of urgency. It’s as if to say, “God, we need you now.” I find that, these days, I never stop needing God. I need him all of the time, whether I am conscious of my need or not.</p>



<p>Today is Never Give Up Day. It is a worldwide holiday aimed at helping individuals who are suffering from various forms of pain and grief. It is meant as an encouragement us to not give up and keep on going.</p>



<p>Today is also National Fajita Day as well as National Ice Cream Pie Day. And if I had known about either one of these in advance, I might have been better prepared to celebrate. Maybe next year.</p>



<p>Lord,<br>Help me to not give up, but to do it because I know that you are with me.</p>



<p>Help those who have suffered loss. Be with them and encourage them as they face yet another day with whatever it is they are suffering. Thank you that, as long as we are alive, you never give up on us.</p>



<p>May ever day be a day to celebrate because of what Jesus has done on the cross: redeeming me and giving me a future that is better and brighter that I can ever imagine. Thank you.</p>



<p>In Jesus’ name,<br>Amen</p>
