<p>Today is Collector Car Appreciation Day. Try saying that three times fast.<br>It’s not just about old or fancy and unique cars. A while industry has been built around the automobile. Globally, revenue from just the sale of cars, themselves, was about $31.5 billon, with a growth rate of about 8%. That’s a lot of money and outdoes most stocks on the US Stock Exchange.</p>



<p><br>Aside from the cars, there is petrol, oil changes, car washes, hotel stays, advertising fees, photographers and models. It all adds up, and this money goes out to local businesses.<br>My dream car is a Mercedes, convertible from the early 1980s. I will probably never own one, but it’s nice to dream. It would likely be deep blue with brown leather seats.</p>



<p><br>What is your dream car?</p>



<p>For me, it’s more than a dream of having a particular car. I’m more than happy with the car that I have: a 2017 gray Jeep. I’m even happier that I’m no longer driving a 1991 van: ugly in every way.<br>For me, the Jeep reminds me that things can get better, no matter how I may feel at the moment. It’s also a reminder that my God is my source and my provider. And, because of this, I don’t have to worry about tomorrow.</p>



<p>If I begin to worry, as I am prone to do from time to time, I can go from 0 to panicked in .60 seconds. But, if I keep my eyes on God, and His Word in my heart (mind), there is really nothing to fear.</p>



<p><br>How can we celebrate Collector Car Appreciation Day? It may depend on where you live. If, for example, you live in a rural community, it may be that you or your neighbor has one of these in his or her yard. You may be able find a collector car at a local car dealership. You can also find photos and posters online. And there are car magazines. Finally, there are toy, model and remote control cars.<br></p>



<p>Perhaps, just learning something new is what matters. Personally, I would say that hope is what matters. And, it matters where we put on hope. My hope is in God: the Father, Son and Holly Spirit. Where do you find your hope?</p>
