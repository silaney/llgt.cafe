<p>Feeling stuck. Not sure how to get out of the daily grind? Maybe you just want to try something different but aren’t sure where to start. Here are some ideas that may help.</p>



<p>Start small. Take a moment to write down a list of things that you would like to start doing: exercising, eating more vegetables, remembering to feed your dog, for example. Find a place to put this list where you can see this list each morning and throughout the day. I have mine on a dry eras board. If you want to walk each day, start out with a two to ten minute walk. On weekends, I may walk three hours or more, but I try to walk a little each day, even if it’s to the fridge.</p>



<p>Try joining a church, a church small group for larger churches, or a club. Volunteer for a local charity or for the library. There are so many organizations that can use volunteer help.</p>



<p>Seek a new job/career or get a second job. You may have to do this if you loose your current job for whatever reason. Hopefully, this doesn’t happen, but it happens all the time. It can seem like a good thing, but often, it does’t. Either way, put your energy into finding something new and, if possible, exciting.</p>



<p>Take up a hobby. There are so many to choose from. Just within art there is photography, watercolor, pastel, color pencil, charcoal, those little fluffy things and so much more. You may even want to take a class that can help you learn a craft and may help you meet others who are also interested in art.</p>



<p>Teach a class. I found a local store, Natural Grocers, that allows me to use their kitchen to teach a class. They also provide me with up to $100 groceries to use as a demo. They do have rules that I am required to follow but nothing too difficult. I’ve only done one class but another is scheduled for next month. Just make sure that, if you decide to teach your class that you know your subject. Curiosity helps, too.</p>



<p>Find others to go for walks with. There may be a local photography club, too, as well as writers and speakers clubs. You should be able to do a Google search for local clubs.</p>



<p>The greatest/best change in my life came when I put my faith in Jesus to pay my sin debt and restore a relationship with God. John 3:16 (KJV) tells us that, <strong>“ For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</strong> It gives us what we cannot earn and what none of us deserve: forgiveness, wholeness and eternal life. Some things, we get as soon as we accept God’s gift, while other things take a lifetime to change. A prayer of salvation is just the beginning.</p>



<p>Change can be hard at times, especially if it is forced on us. But it doesn’t have to be. It’s our decision as to whether we see change as a good or bad thing. Try to see it as a good thing. In one way, change will occur, with or without us.</p>



<p>Note: I’m not talking about some changes that others may try to force upon us. Even a lie can seem true if you hear it often enough. Keep an open mind to differing views and you should be able to decide what to think about differing issues on your own. Is there a write and wrong? In some cases, yes, but in others, no. You are the one who decides which is which, at least in your own mind. And this, too, may change over time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Warming: the following material could be heartbreaking. If you like, you may skip to the end.</strong></p>



<p>At Some point of our lives, each of us is a victim. It may be a crime, such as theft or vandalism. It may be abuse: sexual, emotional or physical. For all too many, life begins and ends with the abuse known as freedom of choice. Most of us just fall victim to the results of our own choices.</p>



<p>Each persons behavior is based on what he or she sees in other, on television and in movies, or listens to in the form of others or the music that that individual listens to. So someone who has been hurt by others — “You’re such a dummy” — is more likely to hurt others. Crime, gossip and abuse don’t begin with the act, they begin with a though.</p>



<p>“Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.” — Matthew 5: 21-22 (KJV)</p>



<p>God is much more concerned about our thoughts — our heart — than our our intents. It’s not intentions that lead to action; it’s our thoughts. We do, however, have the ability to stop when we see a negative though forming in our mind. We can stop and think. Unfortunately, not everyone realizes that he can change his thought pattern. And it we constantly feed on violence and a thought of hatred enters our mind, violence is likely to ensue.</p>



<p>It is important who and what we listen to. Television and movies are often meant to instill fear. They cause us to laugh at the wrong thing — mainly sin and perversion. Music can cause us to believe the wrong things, and material found of the Internet can cause thoughts of anything from fear to jealousy and lust.</p>



<p>Just one statistic shows that “22% of individuals assaulted by a partner at least once in their lifetime (23% for females and 19.3% for&nbsp; males).” Unfortunately wether the perpetrator realizes his/her abuse or not, whether the victim realizes their abuse or abuser or not, most people lack the resources to do anything. The sad part is that all too many victims are too young to recognize abuse and certainly too young to express what they may have experienced. “This must be normal,” one tells himself.</p>



<p><strong>You can pick up here if you like.</strong></p>



<p>I think I’ve made my point. At some time, each of us a victim. Now comes the choice: we say “Yes, I am a victim, and I deserve to be angry, resentful or bitter. Where’s my phone? I need to call a lawyer.” But that’s not the answer. What we should do is turn to the Savior: our Great Physician.</p>



<p>You can start wit the book of John <a href="http://Book of John https://content.wtsbooks.com/shopify/pdf_links/9781433558955f.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(PDF)</a>. Or you can start with verses like:</p>



<p>“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” — John 3:16 (KJV)</p>



<p>“That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” — Romans 10:9 (KJV)</p>



<p>Faith is a process that begins as a seed, takes root in the Word of God and beings to grow. A relationship with our Savior isn’t a religion and it’s not something that we can do on our own. We need to go to God and simply trust in the finished work of Jesus, his death on the cross to pay for our sins and his resurrection. We need to believe that Jesus, born of a virgin, lived a perfect and sinless life, was both fully God and fully man so that he could save us from our sins and restore the relationship with God that you and I truly long for.</p>



<p>It may begin with a prayer like this: “God, thank you for sending your only son to die to pay for my sins. I’m confessing that I’m a sinner and I ask you to forgive me, not because of anything that I do, but because of Jesus’ precious blood, spilt on a cross to pay my sin debt.”</p>



<p>What next: Find a church that teaches the Bible: preferably only the Bible, and doesn’t try to fill your mind with self help books and platitudes. If you find such a church, become a member. Hint, if the church is growing, it may be a good church. Visit that church and listen to who and what they talk about. Baptism is important, but not a requirement and it doesn’t give anyone eternal life. Spiritual gifts are a matter for another time.</p>



<p>If ever you feel threatened by someone or feel that your life may be in danger and cannot say, “I need the police to come help me,” dial 911 and press send. When the operator answers, say, “Yes, I’d like to order a pizza.” The operator with know what to do.</p>



<p>There are also videos that can help victims of abduction and sex trafficking: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GfsS4HH2Uw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Link to video</a></p>



<p>Parents should talk to their kids about what victimization looks like. Don’t frighten then but give them ideas of what they might do if someone approaches them. Practice situations that your child may experience and, by all means, keep lines of communication open, which means that you may have to confess your own faults and failures. After all, there’s no better teacher than personal experience. And admitting our own failures won’t kill us or make us look likes less of a person — except to the one who is out to get us.</p>

<p>There is help out there. If you see someone who looks like she needs help, take time to get to know that person. Ask questions.<br>If you could go anywhere in the world, where would you go?<br>What’s you’re favorite sport, color, food…<br>What are your plans for upcoming holiday/weekend?</p>



<p>Finally, be a friend. Find someone who seems isolated.  Offer her a Pop-tart a smile and some encouragement.  Find out what kind of music he or she likes. Just start talking. Just show that you care. And smile. Keep your smile, it still works and it looks good on you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When it comes to our emotions, there are a couple of rules that we ought to follow. The first is probably easier and it’s this: don’t take up another persons complaint. This isn’t to say that if someone is having a problem that you shouldn’t try to help, but if you know someone who has something agains another person, you shouldn’t take up the other person’s complaint as if it were your own.</p>



<p>I’m not talking about when someone is harassing or bullying someone that you care about. And it’s just fine to listen to someone to help him or her work through what the core problems might be and to talk about any possible solutions, but becoming angry at someone for what they did to someone else does no good.</p>



<p>The other rule is that we should not let others have total control over our emotions. A friend put it this way: others can make me happier, but they cannot take away my happiness. It’s a good way to look at those around us, and it’s a good idea for our circumstances as well. We need to have a base level of happiness that comes from within, something that won’t go away if our circumstances or someone else tries to take it away.</p>



<p>It’s no surprise that, because of the control necessary to train in kung fu that the martial arts teach a high level of control, not only of the body but also the mind. And, if you like, you can train in the martial arts, or you can become a monk in order to learn to control your emotion. You can also just decide to follow these two rules. But remember that it can take time to make these rules a part of your life.</p>



<p>Doing these things is kind of like exercising a muscle. The more we practice these skills, the better we will become at following them. For years, I was content with my surroundings — friends and family, and even my job. And thought there were times when I felt trapped, I wasn’t in any hurry to change either. Then life happened and I was forced to make changes in my life.</p>



<p>I’ll admit, it wasn’t easy, building a new life. And after two years of settling in to my new lifestyle, live happened, again. This time, however, I was kind of ready for it. I say kind of because being out of work for nearly three weeks was kind of hard, but it wasn’t unbearable. And now that I’m working at my new job, I&#8217;m okay with my circumstances.</p>



<p>One thing that I’ve seen is that we can be happy in the worst of circumstances as we can be miserable in the best of circumstances. It’s not our circumstances that make us happy or miserable but how we choose to see the details within our circumstances.</p>



<p>Maybe you’ve grown tired of seeing the same view day after day, month after month and year after year. You can choose to see the world around you through new eyes. It’s your choice. You can do it.</p>



<p>It may take a little more work to choose your own emotions but, in the end, the results are well worth the extra effort that it takes. But don’t take my word for it. Try it, you’ll like it. And if you don’t, you can ask for a full refund.</p>

<p>There is so much that we have available to us in the way of educational resources. Unfortunately, there are a few things that can stop us along the way. Yet, even if we come across a road block, there are things that might help us move forward.</p>



<p><strong>Distractions</strong><br>Distractions are one of the main things that can keep us from learning. It could be the TV, the computer, your phone with it’s social media, or something else. It could be something that you enjoy doing, like playing video games, or it could be keeping up on the latest and worst news of the day.</p>



<p>In this case, it’s important to remember matters most. It’s easy to do the things that are easy or that we enjoy doing. If learning is important to you, you will need to make a conscious effort to spend time learning, or even practicing a particular skill. Put it on your calendar, or schedule it at the same time every day/week. If it’s a new habit, start small, and make sure you reward yourself for your accomplishment.</p>



<p><strong>Time Lag</strong><br>Some times we don’t learn as well as we ought because there may be a lag between the time that we do something and when we see the results of that action. This is likely why the saying that those who fail to learn from their past are doomed to repeat it is so true. Many things in this life and, in the world in general, occur in cycle. Unfortunately, it can be hard to see these cycle, and even harder to see the correlation between one thing, or one even, and another.</p>



<p>Journaling may help, at least with shorter cycles: weeks, days, months and maybe even year long cycles. Unfortunately, life and history can fall into 80, 100, and even 1,000 year cycles, and these can be much harder to follow.</p>



<p><strong>Schooling</strong><br>Some times the very study of something can hinder our leaning and growing in that area. Often, I found, those who graduate from cooking school, often have the hardest time finding a job in food service. One might have such high hopes when entering cooking school. It’s easy to think that, because you’ve spent so much time and money on your education that you deserve to be paid more. Unfortunately, an education may just the foundation for learning.</p>



<p>One solution is to realize that you don’t know everything. Stay eager to continue learning and practicing whatever it is that you are doing. Learning without practicing is of little use. Practicing without learning will only get you so far.</p>



<p><strong>Fear of Failure</strong><br>It’s true, learning something new often involves failing. Depending on how you were brought up, failure can either be a really bad thing, something to be avoided at all cost, or just a normal part of the learning process. Failure is something that can either propel you forward, or stop you in your tracks.</p>



<p>It’s important to realize that we all make mistakes or fail in one way or another. But the more we work at something, the better we will get at it, and the fewer mistakes we will make. The important thins is that, when we do fail or make a mistake, that we learn something from it. Rather than torturing ourselves, we can turn it into something positive.</p>

<p>When we learn something, we take in knowledge either through study or by having someone teach us. Learning is meant, in some way to change what we do, what we know, how we do, or how well we do something. We can, for example, learn a new language, learn about places in other parts of the world, or learn the history of our won country.</p>



<p>Learning, like exercise, isn’t always fun, and it’s not always easy. It may involve subjects that we are not interested in. And we may even find ourselves trying and failing at what we are trying to learn. Yet, like exercise, learning is a choice. And the only way that we can completely avoid the possibility of failure is to do nothing.</p>



<p>Learning is meant to have some impact on our lives. Not only does it give us a stronger and healthier brain, it should have a positive impact on our lives. That isn’t to say that everything that is taught is worth learning, but the things that are worth learning should make some sort of change in our lives.</p>



<p>In high school and college, much of what we learn is measured only in our ability to successfully pass a test. In college or in a trade school, we may learn a particular skill — anything form home making to computer programming, to practicing medicine — that we can take and either find a job or start our own business. But even the best high schools and colleges cannot teach us everything that we need to survive and thrive in an ever-changing world.</p>



<p>Rather than seeing learning as a sprint, we should see it as a marathon. We shouldn’t think that once we have finished high school or even college that we can stop learning and coast along on the knowledge that we have already gained. Instead, we should see it as a marathon, or an ongoing race. We complete one mile, not so that we can stop and rest, but so that we can begin the next mile.</p>



<p>Learning may or may not make us better than anyone else at something, but it should make us better at something, today, than we were yesterday. Whether we learn though reading, listening, watching, or doing, we should always seek to be better than we were, yesterday. Even if we make mistakes, or fail along the way. Because, in a way, failure can be one of life’s best teachers.</p>
