<p>Dear Diary,<br>This was today’s Bible verse: “Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence.” — Isaiah 64:1 (KJV)</p>



<p>To rend is to tear, but with a sense of urgency. It’s as if to say, “God, we need you now.” I find that, these days, I never stop needing God. I need him all of the time, whether I am conscious of my need or not.</p>



<p>Today is Never Give Up Day. It is a worldwide holiday aimed at helping individuals who are suffering from various forms of pain and grief. It is meant as an encouragement us to not give up and keep on going.</p>



<p>Today is also National Fajita Day as well as National Ice Cream Pie Day. And if I had known about either one of these in advance, I might have been better prepared to celebrate. Maybe next year.</p>



<p>Lord,<br>Help me to not give up, but to do it because I know that you are with me.</p>



<p>Help those who have suffered loss. Be with them and encourage them as they face yet another day with whatever it is they are suffering. Thank you that, as long as we are alive, you never give up on us.</p>



<p>May ever day be a day to celebrate because of what Jesus has done on the cross: redeeming me and giving me a future that is better and brighter that I can ever imagine. Thank you.</p>



<p>In Jesus’ name,<br>Amen</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There is a saying that hard times can either make us better or bitter. That is, the difficulties that we face can make us stronger in character or make us angry and, perhaps, make us more isolated.</p>



<p>There is another side to that. Hard times can either draw us to God or away from God. Whether we realize it or not, we are always moving in one direction or another: towards God or away from Him. And we either have a relationship with God or we don’t.</p>



<p>The good news, the Gospel, tells us that it’s easy to begin a relationship with God. John 3:16 tells us, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</p>



<p>It seems that everyone has difficulties at times, whether we believe in God or not, whether we have a relationship with God or not. Hard times are, it seems, just a part of life.</p>



<p>I was fourteen when I began my relationship with the living God thought Jesus Christ and what he did and who he is: born of a virgin, lived a perfect life, died on a cross, a ransom for my sins, and rose again. Jesus us as much God as the Father and the Holy Spirit: three in one. It’s not something I can fully, 100% understand, but I’m okay with that.</p>



<p>Some times, I look at the news, and I don’t understand the things that others are going through. The killing and such just seems beyond my comprehension. Wars just never seem to end and, when one does, there is another one around the corner. But for those who believe, for those who have a relationship with the living God, there is this promise: “And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.” — Romans 8:28 (KJV)</p>



<p>I have to admit that it took me many years to figure out how some of the events that took place in my life could work for my good, but I’ve begun to figure it out. Either that, or I’ve just decided to accept it by faith.</p>



<p>Which way are you headed, towards God or away from him? Do you have a relationship with God. If so, God’s Word promises that no one and nothing can take you away from him. I’m counting on that, because I’m still nowhere near perfect. But I am moving closer to God. And hopefully each day, with the help of the Holy Spirit, I’m becoming more and more like Jesus.</p>

<p>Dear Diary,<br>I woke up early enough to go for a walk before church. Today’s teaching was the last in a series on the Sermon on the Mount, from Matthew 7. The thing that sticks out most in my mind is that the narrow road may be hard, but it is the only way to eternal life, for it leads to the only source of eternal life, which is Jesus.</p>



<p>“Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” — John 14:6 (KJV)</p>



<p>It rained while I was helping with parking. And it was windy, so I think we all got at least a little wet. I got wet because it wasn’t raining when I went into church and had to go to my car to grab my umbrella before going to help with parking</p>



<p>I heated up some chicken as part of my lunch, adding the last of my Chinese BBQ sauce.</p>



<p>The church has Growth Track later today and I signed up to go. I was hoping to audition for singing, but I think I’ll spare them having to hear me sing. Anyway, I’m fine with parking duty.</p>



<p>God,<br>Thank You for loving me. Thank You for sending Jesus to live and to die that I might have eternal life.</p>



<p>Help all of those who are homeless and hungry. But even more than food and shelter, they need to know You.</p>



<p>In Jesus’ name,<br>Amen</p>

<p>It’s a new day<br>One for which<br>I did not pay</p>



<p>It’s new to me<br>And new to you<br>what will we see<br>and what will we do</p>



<p>I do not know<br>Will I shrink<br>or will I grow<br>Shrink in fear<br>Or grow in knowledge</p>



<p>Will I be better today<br>Than I was yesterday<br>Or will I stay the same<br>Or grow in fame<br>Will I die to self<br>And learn to live<br>Will I keep<br>Or choose to give</p>



<p>Who knows<br>What the day will bring<br>Will it be different<br>Or the same<br>Is life a burden<br>Or is it a game<br>I give you my time<br>I sell it for a dime</p>



<p>Is it over now<br>Or just getting started<br>Will I glow bright<br>Or flame be retarded<br>Will I be a start<br>Shine from afar<br>Can you see my light</p>



<p>Can you see me fight<br>To resist myself<br>To lay in bed<br>And lay my head<br>And close my eyes<br>Or go instead</p>



<p>To go out<br>And change my world<br>To change myself<br>To be the same<br>Or build a shelf</p>



<p>To do something<br>For someone else<br>Of for myself<br>With someone else</p>



<p>To be alone<br>Or be with you<br>In mine own zoo</p>



<p>&nbsp;It is of the Lord&#8217;s mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness. The Lord is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. Lamentations 3:22-24 (KJV)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Do you want some good news? I think it’s good, tough you are welcome to disagree.</p>



<p>Deuteronomy 23: 35-36 (KJV) says, “To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste. For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.”</p>



<p>You know what this means? For me, it means I don’t need to judge others or worry about doing so. And, really, I have desire to judge others. It’s too hard to tell who is telling the truth and who is lying. It’s too hard to tell the motives for any given acton. It’s nearly impossible to walk in someone else’s shoes.</p>



<p>No, I don’t know way I do many of the things that I do. So how can I expect myself to be able to understand why others do the things that they do? Answer: I cannot.</p>



<p>Say, for example, I have two children. Say that the two get into a fight and, when confronted, each blames the other. It would be a mistake to choose one over the other, but that is the tendency. Instead, both should be equally punished. Right?</p>



<p>Perhaps, or perhaps not. Maybe the best thing to do would be to help the two to find a way to work it out: to mediate a deal between the two. Far above what punishment could do, this could be a true life lesson.</p>



<p>I don’t know about you, but I am all too quick to judge other’s motives or intent. And, when I do, it can have lasting and negative effects on me and on my relationships.</p>



<p>There is, however, one thing that we can do. We can be open with each other. If something bothers us, we can say, this thing that you are doing makes me uncomfortable. It hurts me when you…..</p>



<p>We should avoid saying things like, “You are a bad person,” and “I don’t like you.” These are things that probably aren’t true, or may be true for a short time. Really, “I don’t like you” is just a way of saying “I’m mad, or sad, or both.”</p>



<p>Instead of judging, I can listen. I can ask questions and try to figure out what went wrong. I can also offer possible solutions. If a fix to the problem is found, great. If not, it may take more time. If no solution is found, maybe one person or the other just don’t want to admit that he or she may be wrong. But, again, it’s not possible for me to know with 100% certainty. Only God knows, and only God can judge the heart.</p>



<p>“Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, ‘Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord’” — Romans 12:19 (KJV)</p>



<p>What do I take away from this? I can and should be more patient — with myself and with others. I don’t need to judge others or their motives. I don’t even really need to judge my own motives. Now, if I need help with a matter, I should find out the best person to talk to. If I need medical advise, I should talk to a doctor. If I need to know how to spell a work, I find that Google works well. If I’m part of a fight, I should realize that I am part of the problem. And when I come to this realization, I should stop, step back and ask, “What is the real problem?”</p>



<p>What do you think? I think that this is good news. But you are welcome to disagree.</p>

<p>Last night, I watched a short update on the war in Israel and Gaza. If we think that the 2024 presidential elections will divide the United States of America, this war has the potential to divide the whole world.</p>



<p>Mostly, I’m avoiding news on this war. But there is one person whose perspective I trust. So, whose side am I taking? Neither. I believe that both sides are wrong and that both sides are killing innocent people: men, women and children who have nothing to do with this war.</p>



<p>It’s complicated. The animosity between the two goes way back. And the situation seems bleak. Still, I pray. When I pray, I pray for both sides that the killing will stop and that God will help the most vulnerable. God can do what man cannot. God can bring peace. But I also believe that there is only peace though Jesus, the prince of peace.</p>



<p>So I pray: Father, help those who are hurting. Help those who have lost family members or have family who are in danger. Protect the children, Lord. You alone can bring peace. In Jesus name, amen.</p>

<p>Who am I? It’s one of those deeper questions that we ask ourselves from time to time. And we may get a different answer each time.<br>I’m not entirely sure who I am. In short, I’m Ralph. I know who I’m not. I’m not the things I own, the people I know or the things that I have done. These things may help shape me, but they don’t make me who I am. Another thing I am not: I am not what I was and I am not yet who I will be.</p>



<p>I was 14 when I asked Jesus to be lord of my life, which was 43 years ago. After hearing the Gospel, I realized that I was a sinner and that God had sent His Son to die on a cross so that I might have eternal life.</p>



<p>Because I was so shy at the time, I couldn’t pray out loud. That has certainly changed. I’m no longer shy about praying out loud and some times as others if I can pray with and for them.</p>



<p>Anyone can become a follower of Jesus. We don’t have to live a particular lifestyle. We just need to have faith that Jesus can save us from our sins. Really, He is the only one who can. I cannot save myself from my sins. I put my faith in Jesus and God gave me eternal life. He also gave me the Holy Spirit to help guild me. If you like, you could say I’m born again.</p>



<p>What else is true? I am loved. I am fearfully and wonderfully made. I am a child of the living God. How about you? John 3:16 (KJV) says that, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” Are you a whosoever? I’m a whosoever.</p>
