<p>Is it possible to fail to success? Is it possible to go right by turning left enough times? The answer to both of these is yes. But they leave something unanswered. How many times does one have to turn left to be going to what would have been to the right, and how many times does it take someone to fail before succeeding?</p>



<p>The answer is, it’s different for everyone. Walt Disney is just one example of someone who failed to success, but so is Thomas Edison. It took him about a thousand tries before he came up with the right material to put into the light bulb.</p>



<p>Failure can help point us in the right direction by helping us to see the wrong direction. But success is more than not failing, it’s figuring out what really matters. I could become a successful bank robber, for example, but I know that is not something that I want to do. What I really want to do is to help others and not to hurt them.</p>



<p>One way to shorten the time it takes to succeed is to find a mentor: someone who is or has already done the thing that you or I want to do. So, if you want to sell widgets, find someone who is a successful widget salesperson and ask that person to help you. Some people may offer classes and that is another form of mentorship.</p>



<p>Of course, if you or I aren’t clear on what we want, it’s going to be nearly impossible to know whether or not we’ve found it. So, this is what I would do: put it in writing, and put as much detail as possible. Make a list of things that you want, describing each one in detail — limiting the list to four or five things — and then prioritize them.</p>



<p>I’ve created a business plan that may help. You’ll find it below. Feel free to download it and make as many copies as you like. If you do download it, please let me know if you find it helpful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Did you know that today is National Gossip Day and that gossip can help you or your business make money? It’s true. I just wrote it, so it must be true.</p>



<p>No. Seriously, rumors and gossip don’t actually help you or your business make money. Quite the opposite is true; rumors and gossip can hurt your finances.</p>



<p>Mainly, gossip can cause you to make the wrong financial choices. Rather than knowing what is really going on, it’s possible to get inaccurate information from various sources. I don’t know how many times the stock market was going to crash — and it didn’t. I don’t know how many times banks were doomed and yet banks still exist. Predicting a market or a financial crash is like predicting the next “great” quake to hit California. Even when you think you know, you really don’t know.</p>



<p>Someone may say, “this business has done well in the past, so they are certain to do well in the future.” This may lead us to buy their stocks: stocks that may be doomed to go down because of information that I have not been given. When it comes to advise on buying stocks — or anything else — it’s best to get more than one opinion. For example, I no longer buy supplements on Amazon without getting more than one opinion.</p>



<p>How do we know what is a rumor or just plain gossip? It can be hard to tell. One way to know is if someone has to whisper it. Another way is if someone uses works like “could” or “might” but makes it sound more like “will”: this will help you make more money or will help you live a healthier life.</p>



<p>I remember seeing an add for magnesium that said that this product helped someone sleep much better. After buying magnesium from another source, I watched a YouTube video that said it can help a limited number of people. It seems that I wasn’t one of them. I didn’t spend a lot of money and I can still use the product. But it certainly hasn’t helped me sleep better.</p>



<p>Finally, rumors and gossip can hurt you, your relationships and your business. You may not be able to keep others from spreading rumors about you, but you can put an end to a rumor that goes your way.</p>



<p>In the end, gossip is no good and it can do nothing but hurt others, whether it be financially or personally. The Bible clearly warns against spreading rumors for that very reason. So, if you are tempted to spread gossip about someone, stop, and consider how you might feel if someone said the same thing about you.</p>

<p>Today is Work Like a Dog Day. And though there are no prescribed ways to celebrate, here are a few ideas:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Work harder than you would normally work. Don’t just bark orders, work. Work hard in honor of those who normally put 100% effort into all that they do.</li>



<li>Work like a dog: that is, take a nap, lie in the shade or on the couch.  A hammock works great, too.</li>



<li>Give your service dog a day off or, perhaps, a special treat.</li>



<li>Take your dog to a dog park.<br>Take yourself to a dog park and let your dog come along.</li>



<li>If you don’t have a dog, maybe it’s time to get one. There is probably a local pet adoption agency that you can contact in order to find a dog.</li>



<li>Borrow someone else’s dog for the day. Maybe you have a friend or a relative who wouldn’t mind letting you borrow his or her dog for the day. The two of you can go for a walk, take naps together or, maybe, go for a swim at the lake.</li>
</ul>



<p>Whatever you decided to do, enjoy. If you take one of my suggestions or come up with one of your own, please let me know.</p>

<p>Have you ever wanted to work from home? Maybe you’re wanting to try something new. There are some jobs that work better from home — or on the road. It is not a complete list, and it doesn’t include everything that you will need to know or do to get started, but it should at least help you start thinking about stay-at-home jobs that you might be interested in.</p>



<p><strong>Answering service</strong><br>If you are thinking about starting your own answering service, there you are probably going to need a land line. You might also need a computer, and you may need some way to record incoming calls. It’s also a good idea to have a website, you will need to do some research on pricing, you will need to find clients, and you may need to spend money on advertising.</p>



<p><strong>Call center representative or customer service</strong><br>This will require pretty much the same equipment as an answering service, but instead of taking messages, you would be answering questions, or taking information on issues that could be passed on for further review. You will still need clients clients whom you will be working for, and you may be able to find one company that will not only hire you, but will pay for the installation of all the equipment.</p>



<p><strong>Graphic design</strong><br>There are several types of design that you can do, from logos, to business cards, T-shirts and mugs. One website, fiverr.com, allows you to show off just what you are capable of doing, helps you find clients, and collects the money and pays you for your work. They do, however, take a commission, which is added to the order. It is up to you to set your own price, and you can offer multiple levels of service or features at different price points. You will need a computer and/or a tablet for creating your artwork, and you will also need some sort of design software.</p>



<p><strong>Product photography</strong><br>If you have access to a camera and some products, you may be able to do product photography. You will need to find clients, and you will need to work out the details ahead of time. You will need a place to work, but you may be able to work in your own kitchen or even in your bedroom. Depending on what you are photographing, you will need a little or a lot of space. Besides a camera, you will probably need something to put the product that you are photographing on, as well as a background, and some form of lighting. You may also want to have props. If you choose to do video, you may need things like tripods or sliders. A computer and photo editing software will also be a must. And it will be important to have some place to show off your work.</p>



<p><strong>Technical support</strong><br>Technical support is another job that you can do by phone. You can work for an established business, or try to start your own. Whichever you choose to do, you will need a solid knowledge of whatever it is you are attempting to help others figure out. You are likely to need a lot of patients, as the people who call in may already be frustrated because they have not been able to fix the problem themselves.</p>



<p><strong>Vlogger</strong><br>If you want to produce a Vlog, such as a YouTube channel, the list of topics that you can choose from is nearly endless. You can do something as broad as cooking videos, or as narrow as the history of dental floss. It’s entirely up to you. You will need a camera that you can use to record video, and you may want more than one. It can be as simple as the camera on your cell phone, or as elaborate as you like. It’s said that sound is 50% of the video, so you will need a decent microphone. You may need a computer, but you may also be able to do all of your editing on a smartphone or a tablet. Video editing software and a way to upload your videos to the internet are also musts.</p>



<p><strong>Website design</strong><br>If you already have a working knowledge of web design, this may be the one for you. The more connections you have, the faster you will be able to get started. But remember that your competition could come from half way across the world. If you can find some way that you stand out from the crowd, you may find it easier to find clients. You will need clients, and you will need to figure out your pricing. Along the same lines as web designing is Search Engine Optimization (SEO), which helps existing websites who want to achieve higher rankings on search engines like Google. A computer will come in handy, along with some way to keep in touch with clients.</p>



<p><strong>Writer</strong><br>If you enjoy writing, there are several ways that you can use your skills. You can write a book, a blog, you van write for a magazine, or you may write a syndicated column for newspapers. Like vlogging, you can write on whatever topic you choose. And if you have a way of taking pictures, you can combine your writing and your photography skills to open up even more possibilities. A computer will come in handy, and you may need a connection to the Internet. A publication called “The Writer’s Market” can help you find places that you can sell your writing, and offers advice on how to get started.</p>



<p>Whichever work that you are interested in doing from home, you are likely to need some sort of investment in money and/or time. It takes time to get a business started. Unfortunately, it may take a lot of time — years even — and anyone who says that you can achieve overnight success isn’t telling you the whole story. One other thing you will need is the confidence that you can do it. If you don’t believe in yourself, it’s going to be hard to convince others. Always be honest with yourself and with others. As they say, you only get one chance to make a first impression, and a poor reputation can be nearly impossible to loose.</p>

<p>Is there something keeping you from learning? Perhaps you think you’re not smart enough. Or maybe you think that you’re too old to try something new. Maybe you just don’t know what you might be interested in or what you might like to learn next.</p>



<p>Note that I didn’t mention that you may not know what you might be good at. There are very few things that any of us are good at the very first time we try and, for the majority of us, it takes a lot of practice before anyone outside of our own immediate family will tell us we’re good at something.</p>



<p>I have, for example, worked on my writing for years — mostly in private journals and such. Likewise, I spent years refining my cooking skills. And as far as my photography, it has taken me most of my lifetime to get close to as good as I thought I was when I first picked up a camera. There will always be the critic that will let us know that we aren’t as good at somethings as we think we are. Yet, there are few who will let us know that we can and will get better at whatever we work at.</p>



<p>Not smart enough? Says who? Albert Einstein was not the top student in his early years. Walt Disney failed at least twice before opening Disney. And Steve Jobs was fired from his job at Apple. You may have to adapt your method of learning in order to study a subject, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that you can’t learn.</p>



<p>I’ll never make it on to a professional football/baseball/hockey team, but that doesn’t mean that I cannot throw a ball. The problem isn’t that we’re not good enough. More likely than not, as we get older, we began to compare our work to the work of others, and if our work doesn’t measure up to the work of others, we may get discouraged and give up. Yet, we often fail to take into consideration the time and effort that someone else may have put into doing something, like bounding a ball and putting it though a hoop.</p>



<p>Too old? There are far too many stories — told and untold — of those who began something new or finished something that they started long before, even in their latter years. Likely, however, there are just as many stories of those who gave up while they were still in their youth. Yet, I believe that we are never too old to learn something new.</p>



<p>Maybe you just don’t know where to start. You can look at what you are already doing and go from there. You may also do some research to find out what is being taught in your area or find someone who is willing to teach you what he or she already knows. And, just as we are not as good as we could be at something when we first start, we may not know how enjoyable something might be until we have done it for a while. I, for example, hated typing class. I wasn’t any good at it, and my teacher and I couldn’t seem to see eye to eye. Now, I do much more typing than I do writing by hand. And I kind of enjoy it. It’s the same with the work I now do. I hated some of the lines that I worked on — until I began to get better at it.</p>



<p>Can we do everything? Certainly not. But I believe that most of us can do far more than we ever imagined. At least that’s what experience has taught me.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I saw a calendar that had on the cover “I’m very busy.” It seems to be something that a lot of people brag about. But does staying busy mean that we are getting more done or that the work that we are doing is of greater value?</p>



<p>In life, it’s easy to get distracted. It’s usually the shiny, the impressive or the urgent that catch our attention and take us away from the things that matter. It’s the fact that we are busy that makes us think that what we are doing is of significance. And it may be. Only we can answer that question.</p>



<p>I was out taking pictures with an old digital camera that I have and one of the pictures that I got has two important lessons for each and ever one of us when it comes to our career or to our creative life, and probably our life in general.</p>



<p>The first lesson is to stay focused. It’s kind of a play on words, because the picture is out of focus. The idea is that we, at some point in our lives, need to decide what is most important and try to rid our lives of the things that aren’t as important. This can be material possessions, but it can also be activities that keep us from doing what really matters.</p>



<p>Some time ago, I stopped watching television. That isn’t to say that I don’t watch things online. Yet, I try to reduce the amount of mindless things that I watch and watch more of the things that will help build my knowledge base. If I put on the mindless stuff, it’s usually just to have some noise in the background when I’m doing something else.</p>



<p>The other thing that this picture illustrates is that we shouldn’t bite off more than we can chew. Okay, so this bird more than likely can eat the large seed in its beak, after it removes the outer shell. Still, it may be tempting to take on more than we can do.</p>



<p>Taking on more than we should not only keeps us from doing what is important, but it can add unneeded stress to our lives. Over time, this stress can be hard on our minds and bodies.</p>



<p>As a whole, at least in the United States, we have become consumers. We spend all of our time, buying things and consuming or taking in things of very little value. Being creative, doing work that matters, whether it’s creating a great work of art or raising a family, takes time. It takes commitment and focus to get the absolute best that we can get out of what we are doing.</p>



<p>It’s not possible to know what our future selves might tell ourselves. I heard one lady on the radio say that she would tell her past self to have more fun, to enjoy the time that she spent with her little children more, because the things that mattered then aren’t the things that matter now.</p>



<p>Take the advise of a little bird. As much as possible, stay focused on the things that matter most. It may cost some of the things that we think are important, now. Second, don’t bite off more than you can chew. You may have to work on that as time goes. Don’t be afraid to put things off, to discontinue them or even ask for help from others. Your future self may thank you for it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>“It’s not what you know, but who you know.” I’m sure that these words have been uttered more than once, but is it true?</p>



<p>Honestly, of all the jobs that I’ve worked, I can only think of one job that I had where this might have applied. It was a part time job and the person who hired me and I had worked together before. But was it really because of who I know or who knew me and what she knew about me.</p>



<p>Yes, there are going to be times when a person is going to get a job just because of the person that he knows, but that probably doesn’t happen very often. That friend of mine who gave me a job probably wouldn’t have given me the job if she thought that I was always going to be late, called in a lot or didn’t work very hard.</p>



<p>How did I get most of my jobs? I took a chance. I put in my application and/or resume and interviewed like anyone else. At the same time, those who hired me took the same chance hiring me. Wherever I work, I always try to do my best and, if my best is good enough, then the employer keeps me. If not, or if I’m not happy with the job, I move on and try something else.</p>



<p>It is through hard work and determination that most people succeed. But success isn’t measured solely by the amount of money that someone is bringing in. Success is also measured by our contribution to the world around us and the enjoyment that we get out of doing the work that we are doing. It is easy enough to find people who hate their jobs who won’t do something else because they need the money. To me, this is just being lazy because these people aren’t willing to look for work that they might actually enjoy. Either that, or these people would be miserable no matter what they did.</p>



<p>Whether we work for someone else or have our own business, it’s not who we know but what others know about us. Do others see us as trustworthy, hard working, caring and dependable? Then they will want to do business with us. Do others see us as lazy, uncaring or undependable? Then they are much less likely to want to associate with us.</p>



<p>If someone tells you that you need to work on something, don’t react negatively to it. Take advise as being helpful, because that’s what it usually is. Yes, there will be people who will offer negative criticism, but try not to take it personally. Negative criticism almost always says more about the person doing the criticizing than the one being criticized.</p>



<p>Remember, always do your best, whatever you do. Colossians 3:23 (KJV) says, “ And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men.” If you always do your best, you are going to feel better about yourself. If you do your best, you are more likely to succeed. That’s what matters most.</p>

<p>What’s it like being a chef? I can’t say that I really know. I tried being a sous chef for a while, but it didn’t work out very well. The closest I’ve come was when during the five years that I ran a small soup kitchen in northern Idaho, one day a week except for major holidays. During that time, I planned the menu, purchased the groceries or used what was donated to make a meal, along with the two or more others who volunteered their time. Mostly, it was pretty laid back and the main objective, besides bringing glory to God, was to create a good meal for those who stopped by.</p>



<p>Normally, a chef’s main job is to direct his staff and create meals that customers are eager to come back for again and again, and to make money. The more money a restaurant can make, the better chance it has to stay around. There is a fine balance between spending on the ingredients and the amount of money that is taken in. And a small percentage in the profit, either way, can mean the difference between success and a restaurant closing it’s doors for good.</p>



<p>In my work in the soup kitchen, the budget was very limited. I had the money that was donated, any food that was donated, and a small amount of money from the church where the meals were served.</p>



<p>Most restaurants don’t allow for much creativity. There might be one item on a menu that changes from day to day if there is something that needs to be used, or if there is a special purchase. Most restaurants have the same menu day after day. New items are rarely added to most menus and they are usually dropped if the profit margin is too low to keep that item, even if it is a popular item.</p>



<p>A friend observed that just after Christmas, a lot of fast food restraints come out with their own version of a chicken sandwich. There is a certain amount of competition in the restaurant business, though many of the fast food restaurants are owned by the same company.</p>



<p>Hiring and keeping a staff is one of the major issues in the services industry. When I was in cooking school, I had heard that the turnover rate was as high as 300%. During my time in the soup kitchen, I had the same two people helping me in the kitchen the whole time. We did have others who helped. One of the men who helped had a niece who would help and there were others.</p>



<p>I can’t say that I envy those at the top in the restaurant business. Drinking is just one of the problems that is common as the stress can be very high. One mistake by one of the staff can cost the restaurant in the millions. And, now, more restaurants are struggling than ever, as are other businesses, especially the small ones.</p>



<p>At the same time, soup kitchens and food pantries are in greater demand in many places. Even schools are starting to send food to homes where children are not attending classes while the need for meals still exists.</p>



<p>Chef is just a fancy word for chief: the one in charge. In a lot of jobs you will find that there are too many chiefs and not enough Indians. That’s because we forget that being in charge means serving others, and not about getting our own way. That’s what I miss about being in the soup kitchen: serving others.</p>

<p>If you could choose any career where you could make the most difference, what would you choose? It’s not as if there are any jobs that don’t make a difference in the lives of others — from doctors to trash collectors — but there are some that seemingly make a greater difference. Which one might you choose?</p>



<p>Teaching is one career that has the potential to impact a number of people. It can be a positive impact, but teachers can also have a negative impact on some of their students. Not everyone learns the same and not every teacher can reach every student, but the potential to reach students, to impact their lives well into the future is still great.</p>



<p>Someone in the medical field also may have a chance to impact the lives of others, whether shot tor long term. It’s a demanding job that may pay well, but can bring with it a great deal of stress. It’s a hard job to stay with long term but can have its rewards as well as its drawbacks. And it’s easy to get into debt to complete one’s education.</p>



<p>Journalists have the opportunity to tell stories: to let others know what is happening in the world around them. Its the rare story that makes a real impact in the lives of others, and many stories go unread by the masses, but there is still that chance to break that story or share that truth that could make a difference.</p>



<p>Law enforcement have a job that I don’t envy. Their job is to fix things when they go wrong and to find criminals. We know what happens when things go wrong: the wrong person is arrested or the innocent is killed. But there are times when people’s lives are saved, people are protected, and there are times when justice is served.</p>



<p>Inventors have an opportunity to change the future. Usually, those who invent don’t work alone but work for a larger company or alongside others who help them. It takes people with an inventive mind to create better transportation, easier ways to do things and new ways to save lives. There is almost no limit to want inventors can come up with.</p>



<p>Athletes have a unique opportunity. Those who make it to the professional level can not only make better than average salaries, but they can use their notoriety to help others: raising funds to help those in need, visiting children and their families in hospitals, and just encouraging young people to go further.</p>



<p>Politicians can have a major impact on a countries future. We tend to think of today’s politicians as crooks, seeking only after their own interests, but there are good politicians out there, making a positive difference, going against the crowd to help others.</p>



<p>I would love to find a way to help children. I once had the idea to put together a photo book to sell and raise money to help these homeless children, but nothing ever came of it. What would you do? Maybe you are already making a positive impact on the lives of those around you. One of the places that we can make the biggest difference is in the home. It cannot be understated the difference that a mother, a father or a guardian can have on children, and it can’t be underestimated the power that families have on a nation. We can make a positive change or we can make a negative one. Which would you choose?</p>

<p>If you are thinking about picking up and traveling, whether you plan on spending the year traveling around your area or you plan on spending some time in another country, there are more options now then there were just twenty or thirty years ago. Internet and high speed communication has not only allowed people in places outside of the United States to do jobs that once had to be done domestically but also allow people to take many jobs wherever they want.</p>



<p>You may not need a computer for this first one, though many restaurants use computers these days to keep track of their inventory. When I went into the military, I wanted something that I could use when I got out. I wasn’t interested in being a mechanic or learning something that might be so specialized that it would be of no use when I got out. Maybe you’ve heard of the degree in underwater basket weaving. It’s one of those jobs that it’s hard to find in the market place. Or maybe a degree in general studies.</p>



<p>It turned out that what I learned about cooking was only a small part of my culinary education. It did, however, lead to most of my international travel but certainly not most of my domestic travel.</p>



<p>Photography is another thing that I would like to do. I’ve been able to take pictures wherever I go, but I’ve never been able to do it professionally. The amount of money that I’ve made over the years likely wouldn’t pay even a month’s worth of rent, now. Yet there are wedding photographers, photojournalists and photographers who make YouTube videos who are able to travel to different parts of the world and make at least enough money to live off of.</p>



<p>One of my friends in Spokane had a business promoting concerts. This job took him over a wide area of the United States, with offices in at least a few states and at least a few hundred employees.</p>



<p>I have another friend who is a doctor. I’m not sure whether or not he travels, but I know that there are doctors who travel on missions trips, often offering free services in areas where medical help may be harder to find. There are even huge ships dedicated to helping people in these areas, all paid for by donations and run mostly by volunteers.</p>



<p>Speaking of volunteering, I knew someone who was planing to go to Hawaii to work on an organic farm. This work was volunteer work, but I guess he had enough money saved up that it wasn’t an issue for him. Some of the students from the culinary school where I attended went to places like New York City to work for top chefs on television programs, not for any money but for the ability to be able to put it on their resume and for the money that they might be able to make later in their careers.</p>



<p>If you can get your own television show, that may allow you to travel. Being in movies might do the same, though more and more movies these days do their travel virtually these days. If you can’t get a studio to pay your way, maybe YouTube or some other form of social media will.</p>



<p>If you can do well enough on Amazon, selling your products online or making money through affiliate marketing, then you should be able to pay your own way. I found one family on YouTube, The Kelley Krew, that was able to take to the road with a family of six, now seven, and spend that year in a large travel RV and truck.</p>



<p>There are other jobs as well that will allow you to travel, whether you are working for someone else or working independently: whether you require $100 thousand or more to get through the year or just a few hundred a month to get by. it’s all up to you. And, of course, local restrictions on travel.</p>
