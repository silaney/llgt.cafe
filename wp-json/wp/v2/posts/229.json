It can also be a time of elevated stress. There are gifts to buy, places to go, and decorations to put up. Work hours may be cut, or it may be one of the busiest times of the year. There\u2019s less daylight, and hard times may even hit harder at this time of year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are things that can be done that may help get through some of the difficulties, and even have a happier holiday season.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, set aside time to relax. Often, this is something that doesn\u2019t just happen on it\u2019s own. We have to intentionally take the time to do nothing but drink a cup of tea, or go for a walk, or read a book: whatever we find relaxing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another option is to do something for ourselves. Like relaxing, this is something that may not come naturally, and may need to be planned. This may include a special trip: whether it be to a restaurant, a spa, or somewhere half way around the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may also do something for others. Aside from the normal gift exchange, we may give of our time, volunteering to feed the homeless, visit those who cannot get out, or babysit children so that the parent(s) can get out of the house.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can make an effort to stress less by removing some of the things from our Christmas to-do list. Meals can be simpler, decorations can be fewer, and we don\u2019t have to invite so many people to our Christmas or New Year\u2019s party. Or, maybe we can delegate some tasks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can work on our connections. While we may need to disconnect from thinks like our television and our phone (games and social media), we may need to reconnect with some of the most important people in our lives. Call those whom we haven\u2019t called in a while, and visit those we can. It can help you, and it can help them as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, take time to be thankful for all that you have, from the relationships, the time of giving and getting, to the freedom that we enjoy.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The holiday season can bring a range of emotions, from glee to loneliness and depression.
