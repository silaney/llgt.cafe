If you are like me, you have to wait for someone to invite you to go bowling. Maybe you are somewhere in between and you go bowling a few times a year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that the last time I bowled was at least five years ago and was related to a company party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are one of those in the middle, consider inviting others to go bowling with you. If you have family, invite them. Bowling can be a lot of fun. Let me know what you think in the comments below.
