I woke up, hoping to take a nap. That didn\u2019t work, so I got up \u2014 way too early. It was perfect weather to go for a walk, so I walked out to the car and went for a drive: to the store, I went, to buy groceries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I bought milk and eggs and chicken \u2014 just to name a few \u2014 and other things I forget. I got art supples for the books that I want to create, and went back for more for the things I forgot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I phoned, looking for fans, but I only found friends. I went to what was supposed to be a single\u2019s Bible study and no one else showed up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve decided that Costco should put air conditioning in their parking lot, with heating in the winter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A friend from high school recognized me at the store and we talked for a while. He owns a T-shirt business, and I am looking for someone to make T-shirts for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just recently found that Lauren Dangle has cytomegalovirus and what it is. I\u2019m praying that God cures her.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laundry is done and I left a positive review of the laundromat. The owner is kind and very polite. In case you happen to be in Fayetteville, Arkansas and need to do laundry, the place is called Laundroama.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, I hope to back some chocolate chip cookies. They\u2019re for me and the people I work with. It it\u2019s not too hot, I\u2019ll go for a walk. Church is tomorrow and I need my beauty sleep.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dear Diary,It\u2019s been a good day, but I\u2019m ready for it to be over.
