If you like, you may skip to the end.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Some point of our lives, each of us is a victim. It may be a crime, such as theft or vandalism. It may be abuse: sexual, emotional or physical. For all too many, life begins and ends with the abuse known as freedom of choice. Most of us just fall victim to the results of our own choices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each persons behavior is based on what he or she sees in other, on television and in movies, or listens to in the form of others or the music that that individual listens to. So someone who has been hurt by others \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019re such a dummy\u201d \u2014 is more likely to hurt others. Crime, gossip and abuse don\u2019t begin with the act, they begin with a though.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYe have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.\u201d \u2014 Matthew 5: 21-22 (KJV)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>God is much more concerned about our thoughts \u2014 our heart \u2014 than our our intents. It\u2019s not intentions that lead to action; it\u2019s our thoughts. We do, however, have the ability to stop when we see a negative though forming in our mind. We can stop and think. Unfortunately, not everyone realizes that he can change his thought pattern. And it we constantly feed on violence and a thought of hatred enters our mind, violence is likely to ensue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important who and what we listen to. Television and movies are often meant to instill fear. They cause us to laugh at the wrong thing \u2014 mainly sin and perversion. Music can cause us to believe the wrong things, and material found of the Internet can cause thoughts of anything from fear to jealousy and lust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just one statistic shows that \u201c22% of individuals assaulted by a partner at least once in their lifetime (23% for females and 19.3% for&nbsp; males).\u201d Unfortunately wether the perpetrator realizes his\/her abuse or not, whether the victim realizes their abuse or abuser or not, most people lack the resources to do anything. The sad part is that all too many victims are too young to recognize abuse and certainly too young to express what they may have experienced. \u201cThis must be normal,\u201d one tells himself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You can pick up here if you like.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I\u2019ve made my point. At some time, each of us a victim. Now comes the choice: we say \u201cYes, I am a victim, and I deserve to be angry, resentful or bitter. Where\u2019s my phone? I need to call a lawyer.\u201d But that\u2019s not the answer. What we should do is turn to the Savior: our Great Physician.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can start wit the book of John <a href=\"http:\/\/Book of John https:\/\/content.wtsbooks.com\/shopify\/pdf_links\/9781433558955f.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">(PDF)<\/a>. Or you can start with verses like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d \u2014 John 3:16 (KJV)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThat if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\u201d \u2014 Romans 10:9 (KJV)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Faith is a process that begins as a seed, takes root in the Word of God and beings to grow. A relationship with our Savior isn\u2019t a religion and it\u2019s not something that we can do on our own. We need to go to God and simply trust in the finished work of Jesus, his death on the cross to pay for our sins and his resurrection. We need to believe that Jesus, born of a virgin, lived a perfect and sinless life, was both fully God and fully man so that he could save us from our sins and restore the relationship with God that you and I truly long for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may begin with a prayer like this: \u201cGod, thank you for sending your only son to die to pay for my sins. I\u2019m confessing that I\u2019m a sinner and I ask you to forgive me, not because of anything that I do, but because of Jesus\u2019 precious blood, spilt on a cross to pay my sin debt.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What next: Find a church that teaches the Bible: preferably only the Bible, and doesn\u2019t try to fill your mind with self help books and platitudes. If you find such a church, become a member. Hint, if the church is growing, it may be a good church. Visit that church and listen to who and what they talk about. Baptism is important, but not a requirement and it doesn\u2019t give anyone eternal life. Spiritual gifts are a matter for another time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If ever you feel threatened by someone or feel that your life may be in danger and cannot say, \u201cI need the police to come help me,\u201d dial 911 and press send. When the operator answers, say, \u201cYes, I\u2019d like to order a pizza.\u201d The operator with know what to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also videos that can help victims of abduction and sex trafficking: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5GfsS4HH2Uw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Link to video<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parents should talk to their kids about what victimization looks like. Don\u2019t frighten then but give them ideas of what they might do if someone approaches them. Practice situations that your child may experience and, by all means, keep lines of communication open, which means that you may have to confess your own faults and failures. After all, there\u2019s no better teacher than personal experience. And admitting our own failures won\u2019t kill us or make us look likes less of a person \u2014 except to the one who is out to get us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>References and Resources:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-domestic-violence-research wp-block-embed-domestic-violence-research\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"so9zlqEyIa\"><a href=\"https:\/\/domesticviolenceresearch.org\/domestic-violence-facts-and-statistics-at-a-glance\/\">Domestic Violence Facts and Statistics At A Glance<\/a><\/blockquote><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Domestic Violence Facts and Statistics At A Glance&#8221; &#8212; Domestic Violence Research\" src=\"https:\/\/domesticviolenceresearch.org\/domestic-violence-facts-and-statistics-at-a-glance\/embed\/#?secret=38Ljn178TM#?secret=so9zlqEyIa\" data-secret=\"so9zlqEyIa\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/violenceprevention\/intimatepartnerviolence\/fastfact.html\">https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/violenceprevention\/intimatepartnerviolence\/fastfact.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps:\/\/www.stopbullying.gov\/\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The National Human Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC) is a national, toll-free hotline for the human trafficking field in the United States and is reached by calling 1-888-373-7888 or e-mailing NHTRC@PolarisProject.org.
