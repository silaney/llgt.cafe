Snakes and grizzly bear probably top that list. I cannot say that I feel a fear of missing out because I think I\u2019ve been there and done that. I feel no need to do the other things. Jumping out of an airplane and standing on the edge of a thousand foot cliff don\u2019t interest me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used to have this feeling \u2014 something I would imagine \u2014 that a grizzly bear would come up from behind, as I got ready for bed, tap me on the shoulder and say, \u201cExcuse me.\u201d No, it never happened, thankfully. That kind of thing only happens in cartoons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my friends in Idaho was an uncle and guardian to some wonderful children. They could scare me, running behind moving vehicles or towards busy highways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having other people watch me as I try to work \u2014 like when I was in cooking school \u2014 used to scare me. But I think I\u2019ve gotten used to it, maybe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I rented a movie. And, for me, it\u2019s been very difficult to watch. It doesn\u2019t show a shark attack (sharks are on my list, too) or zombies. It has a widow, a house cleaner from London, who just wants to buy a dress. It may have a happy ending, but I can only seem to watch about 15 minutes at a time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve felt some emotions in the past. Love is great, but I can remember feeling great sorrow as well. I\u2019ve been hopeful, but I\u2019ve also known confusion, uncertainty and, perhaps, depression. But I\u2019ve survived them all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, having survived something doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t fear it. Often, I\u2019ve had a feeling that something that I really wanted wasn\u2019t going to work out. Usually, these fears are unfounded. And I\u2019ve learned that God really is in charge of this world. If God doesn&#8217;t allow something, it\u2019s most likely because it\u2019s not good for me: that it&#8217;s not part of God\u2019s plan for my life. I may not understand, but I don\u2019t have to. I just have to trust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I still have fears: hurting someone that I love tops that list. I still struggle with certain emotions. That\u2019s why I tend to stick to watching cartoons: ones that are 20 minutes or less are great. The ones that can put me to sleep in under 5 minutes are better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First John 4:18 (KJV) tells us, \u201cThere is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I still have fears \u2014 mostly in areas of my life where my faith is still weak. But I try to focus on what I know, that God loves me and that His plans are good.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s not easy to figure out what I fear most.
