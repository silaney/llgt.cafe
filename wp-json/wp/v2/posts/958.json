Yesterday, I finished my first book in a series called \u201cLetters from a Time Traveler.\u201d It\u2019s not much more than 3,000 words but, still, I\u2019m excited about it. It comes on the heels of having finished my fourth LLGT Cafe magazine. And I\u2019m certainly excited about that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What gets you excited? Now, there are several things I enjoy: a long walk on a cool day, taking pictures, spending time with a friend or cooking a meal for friends are just some examples. However, few things really get me excited and finishing a writing project is one of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You probably already know that excitement produces endorphins in the brain and that is what makes us feel good. It\u2019s too bad that these chemicals aren\u2019t easier to produce. I think that social media can produce these chemicals, and that may be part of the reason that so many are addicted to social media. I consider myself a recovering addict.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exercise is a better source than social media. Too many of us \u2014 myself included \u2014 get our \u201cfix\u201d on social media, passing by exercise or actual social interaction, and it\u2019s sad. Real relationships involve risk. But relationships are worth that risk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long run, exercise is much better than inactivity, even if it\u2019s cooking a meal. I got one of those watches that tracks my activity. If I sit down too long, it lets me know. We don\u2019t need to be excited all of the time. Unfortunately, if we don\u2019t find it in things that we enjoy, then we are more likely to look for it in things that we would rather avoid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what is it that gets you excited? For me, it\u2019s the prospect of helping others.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Happy July 4th.
