It\u2019s something that just makes us feel better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a friend whose comfort food is a cup of tea. She drinks a few cups of tea each day and it\u2019s important that this tea be made properly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some, it\u2019s a cucumber sandwich: white bread, some kind of spread and thin slices of peeled cucumber.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of comfort foods to choose from: chocolates, chicken noodle soup, pizza, spaghetti, mac and cheese, waffles and fried chicken, fried catfish and yogurt are just a few. And comfort foods can come from any meal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my comfort foods is a grilled cheese sandwich. It\u2019s just two slices of buttered bread filled with cheese, grilled and served hot. It\u2019s simple, but sometimes simple is best. Grilled cheese sandwiches can be enjoyed alone or with tomato soup. It doesn\u2019t really matter what kind of bread you use, or what kind of cheese. It should, however be a cheese that melts easily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mac and cheese is another favorite. I like to get my mac and cheese from a deli. To me, it tastes better when it\u2019s sat for a while, but not too long. To me, when it has had some time to sit, it intensifies the flavor. And I like a little salsa on my mac and cheese.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chicken noodle, chicken and rice or chicken and stars are other popular comfort foods, at least in the United States. One of theses is commonly served to someone who isn\u2019t feeling well: someone with a cold or some other ailment. It may be the hydration, the electrolytes or the garlic, but it seems to help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Comfort foods aren\u2019t something that a person is going to eat every day. It\u2019s that rare treat that might just help you get through the day: a piece of chocolate, a piece of fruit, a grilled cheese sandwich or even a cup of tea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is your comfort food? Maybe you have more than one.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>According to Wikipedia, \u201cComfort food is food that provides a nostalgic or sentimental value to someone.\u201d Comfort foods vary from person to person.
