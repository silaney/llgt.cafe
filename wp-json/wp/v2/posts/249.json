Debt issues, housing costs, and a car problems: it can all get very frustrating. And when things seem like they may be getting better, there\u2019s something else to add to the list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m quite familiar with the saying, \u201cIt could always be worse.\u201d And I\u2019m certain that I could find someone who has it worse than I do. I think that, some times, the difficulties that we face in life aren\u2019t necessarily better or worse than what others are going though, just different.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In John 16:33 (KJV) Jesus says, \u201cThese things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do have a choice of what we focus on. We can choose the see the dark and dreary, or we can see the light, even if it\u2019s not yet in sight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, I have what I believe is the best news of all, that Jesus died on the cross to pay the price for my sins. God offers the gift of salvation freely to those who just believe, because of the blood that Jesus shed on the cross.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why art thou cast down, O my soul?<br>and why art thou disquieted within me?<br>hope thou in God:<br>for I shall yet praise him,<br>who is the health of my countenance, and my God.<br>Psalm 42:11 (KJV)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is hope. There is good, because God is good. Some times you just have to look a little harder, and some times you just have to trust. First Corinthians 2:9 (KJV) says, \u201cBut as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I don\u2019t know about you, but I could use some good news.
