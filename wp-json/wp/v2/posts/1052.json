The fact that I grew up in the south doesn\u2019t mean that I enjoy summer temperatures. Having experienced both warmer and cooler climates, I find it easier to deal with freezing temperatures than heat where you could fry an egg on the sidewalk. With that in mind, here are some ways that you can keep cool this summer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way is to just stay inside. You can stay home, go shopping or visit the library or a museum. You may want to visit your favorite restaurant or coffee shop. You might also go for a drive, running the air conditioner or roll the windows down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you cannot stay indoors or, if air conditioning isn\u2019t available, there are some other things you can do to keep cool. First, you can find shade. Shade trees are great. If you have two of them that are close enough together, you can tie a hammock between them. If trees aren\u2019t available, you may want to make your own shade. For this, an umbrella can do wonders. It can be large or small \u2014 big enough for several people or big enough for one person. Either can help protect you from the heat of the hot sun.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other things that you can use to help with higher temperatures. I knew someone in cooking school who used a wet towel, cooled in the refrigerator, to keep cool. I knew others who used personal fans when it got hot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drinking enough water can help. Avoid drinking too much cold water too quickly. There are plenty of water bottles to choose from. Water works best, though you can also add just a little lemon juice if you like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course you can just take a refreshing dip in a pool, lake or river. If one of these isn\u2019t available, you may just want to cool down with water from the garden hose. Check to make sure that the water in the hose isn\u2019t hot, first. Some places have a water park.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A little reminder: pets and people should never be left in a hot car. It\u2019s far too dangerous, as temperatures can rise quickly. Also, hot sidewalks and pavement can burn a little cat\u2019s or dog\u2019s paws.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Summer should be a fun time of the year, filled with vacations and other memorable events. Don\u2019t let the high temperatures keep you from making the most of your summer.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Next week promises to be one of the hottest weeks of the summer.
