If you like, you can bring the TV outside and watch it in the great outdoors. Rent one of the new releases or find an old classic. Make popcorn or other snacks, and have drinks available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you can find some place to go hiking. A long walk and fresh air just may be what you and your friend needs. Bring a camera and\/or binoculars and, if you like, you can bring along a bird book or look for other things, like plants or mushrooms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If crafting is your thing, maybe you can find something to make with your friends. You can use just about anything that you want, from wood to wax, paper to paint. Just about anything that you imagine you can make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could also cook something together. You could bake or barbecue, you could go shopping for the ingredients or catch them at a nearby lake or river. You could have an old fashion ice cream social, or tea for two.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you would rather go for a bicycle ride. You could go for a long or short ride. If you don\u2019t have your own bicycle, some bicycle shops offer rentals that you can get by the hour or by the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps you would rather get together to read one of your favorite books. You can take turns reading, and talking about what you have read. This is something that you can do once, or you can get together on a weekly or monthly basis.<br>If you are musically inclined, maybe you can get together to form a band. This doesn\u2019t mean that you have to record an album or go on tour, but you might be able to preform before a small crowd.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have some ideas of your own, please share them. We would be glad to hear our ideas.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you want to spend time with your friends, and are looking for an excuse to get together, these ideas just may help.
