Peoples and nations are either in the midst of war or are either threatening or being threatened by another. It\u2019s easy to forget the human toll of those who are being affected by these wars.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of us longs for peace. We want peace for our nation and peace for our souls. Yet, it is only in Jesus, the Prince of Peace, that we can actually find peace. The wounds of Jesus can heal us and it is by his blood that we are made clean. It\u2019s only through faith in Jesus that we can see the Father.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u201cFor all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.\u201d \u2014 Romans 3:23 (KJV)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d \u2014 John 3:13 (KJV)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ephesians 2:8-9 (KJV) tells us, \u201cFor by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:Not of works, lest any man should boast.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can look inside for peace. We can negotiate for peace. One day, Jesus will come, and he will put an end to all fighting. Until then, we can at least find peace with God the Father though faith in Jesus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s pretty simple. Faith often asks us to do simple things and it\u2019s often the simple things that are the hardest. A simple prayer like, \u201cFather, forgive my sins,\u201d may be all it takes if it is said in faith.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Real peace will come to the world one day. Till then, we can have a peace with God though his son, Jesus. I hope you find peace.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It seems that peace, like many things, is in short supply.
