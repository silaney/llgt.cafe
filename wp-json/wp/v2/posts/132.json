There are several things that you can do that may help. Below are six thing that you can do that might help either get more ideas or help sort though in order to find the best ideas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Walk<\/strong><br>Go for a walk. As you do, look around, as if you were a tourist, and everything was new to you. Depending on where you live, you may be able to go for a walk in the woods, though neighborhoods, or in a large city. Either way, there are bound to be countless treasures: things that you will see that can inspire you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Listen to music<\/strong><br>Music can also help you be more creative, though, I would suggest something more relaxing, like classical, instrumental, or even jazz. But listen to whatever you like. It may just give you some ideas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Write<\/strong><br>You can write in any form you like, whether traditional paragraph form, or in the form of a mind map. You can write to yourself, to no one in particular, or as a letter to someone else. This is helpful if you have a lot on your mind, and want to sort through and find the best ideas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Draw<\/strong><br>It may be helpful to put your thoughts on paper in drawings or sketches. Or, if you prefer, there are apps that will do basically the same thing. Some people keep a sketch journal, similar to a diary, where they add new drawings every day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Take pictures<\/strong><br>This one works well with going for a walk. As you walk around, you can capture pictures with your camera or cell phone of things that capture your attention: things that inspire you. Later, when you need an idea, you can look back at these pictures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Talk<\/strong><br>If you are working on a project and need some ideas, try talking to someone else. Some times just hearing ourselves talk about a problem can help us come up with the answer that we are looking for. And the person you are talking to just may have a solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step away<\/strong><br>While there are some projects that it\u2019s best not to leave in the middle, some times the best thing to do is to walk way for a while. Do dishes, watch TV, or just take a nap. If there is a problem that we are trying to solve, it may be best to give the subconscious time to work on whatever we are trying to solve.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Feeling stuck, or just want to be more creative?
