Now, I\u2019ve heard it suggested that there are some words that we may want to consider changing or getting rid of because of possible negative connotations. For example, capturing, and taking, as in capturing someone\u2019s image, or taking her picture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the areas of computers, we could consider the hard drive, because who likes things that are hard, or difficult. And I remember someone suggesting that deviled eggs should be called angel eggs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I cannot go though all of the words and decide what might be changed or eliminated because someone might find them offensive, but I have come up with a few new words of my own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Answeresilogist: the person who always seems to have the right answer, even if he has to make it up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boilotomy: the study of the affect of watching water boil on the time it takes for the water to boil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bokehology: the study of lens bokeh, the affect it has on images, and how the word bokeh should actually be pronounced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bokehologist: one who studies bokeh, and looks for the lenses with the best bokeh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Biblegalglophany: the study of the death of a particular book or of books in general.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fartolomy: the study of, and the anatomy of those who will go far in life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jagsock: that gagged edge on your toenail that catches on your sock when you are trying to put it on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kuttie: that little cut that you get, usually on you hand, that you don\u2019t remember getting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remoteish: wishing that thing on the other side of the room had a remote control.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Odread: that stack of books that you hope to one day read.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Waterbotbit: the water that remains in a plastic water bottle after the bottle has been emptied.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zooblomy: when you walk around the zoo on a hot summer day, and all of the animals are hiding in their caves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you have some words that you would like to add to the list. If so, please share them.
