Class doesn\u2019t start for\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a pause. \u201cI\u2014I wanted to make the room look nice for you, Mrs. Rebekah.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThank you, Charles,\u201d said Rebekah, walking into the classroom. \u201cAnd I tracked mud in from outside,\u201d she added, looking back at where she had walked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d said Charles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou can have a seat, Charles, if you like,\u201d added Rebekah, \u201cand wait for class to start. I have to get my notes in order and write on the chalk board.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIs there anything I can do for you, Mrs. Rebekah,\u201d asked Charles?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNo, thank you, Charles.\u201d There was another pause and, \u201cUnless you want to clean up the mud I\u2026. Never mind. Thank you Jack.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs a last gentle breeze, as the sun\u2019s waning fire<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEnliven the end of the day,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAwaiting the gallows, again, I try my lyer&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Rebekah\u2019s mind, she stroked Jack\u2019s straight blonde hair with her fingers and looked deeply into his piercing blue eyes as he spoke these words. But then, when she came to, other students were entering the classroom and Rebekah had to get read ready to teach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rebekah knew very little about Jack, except that he sat in on her World Literature 101 class and that he worked for the university as a janitor.<br>Or, so it seemed, since he kept cleaning the class for Rebekah. Jack wrote, but never turned in any of his work. After class, Jack would disappear until the next class.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One Monday morning, Rebekah found a Bible sitting on her classroom desk. She hadn\u2019t seen it before, but it was old and dust covered as if it had been there for some time. There was an old envelope protruding from the Bible and opening the Bible to the Psalms, Rebekah picked up the envelope, opened it and began reading.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Rebekah,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that this letter finds you well. I\u2019m not sure how I got here, or how I might get back. I can say that year is 1792 and that Paris is lovely this time of year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Le Procope is a lovely cafe if you are able to visit. Remember to pack warm clothes as it is cold this time of year. Also, make sure to celebrate the New Year for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Words cannot express how much you meant to me, Rebekah. I love you so much, and I look forward to being with you once more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Love Always,<br>Charles<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PS: You will first need to go to The Library in town. Look for a small box buried east of the old oak tree. You will know what to do when you find the box. And bring a pitch fork to help you find the box, along with a shovel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIs this a joke,\u201d Rebekah said out loud.? But Charles wasn\u2019t there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rebekah moved the Bible, noting the dust on her hand and the hand prints now on the Bible. Looking up, Rebekah realized that half of her students were already seated, and she had not yet begun to get ready.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the bell rang, Rebekah addressed her students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWho read the first three chapters of \u2018Homer,\u2019\u201d asked Professor Abrams?<br>Most hands went up, while some students just stared. \u201cGood,\u201d added Sarah. I want to start with another question. Say, for example, you find<br>a letter. It\u2019s dated December 5, 1792 and it tells you where to find a box that has been buried. What do you do?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in it,\u201d asked one?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWho tried it,\u201d asked another?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vast number of students, however, indicated that they would dig up the box, while a few students expressed concern that it might be contaminated with \u201chorrible germs.\u201d Never mind them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just after dinner, Rebekah tuned off her television, turned out the lights, locked the door and gently placed a shovel and pitch fork into the back of her pickup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m off,\u201d said Rebekah to herself. \u201cIn more than one way.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pulling into the parking lot at The Library \u2014 where they came up with that name, Rebekah would never know. Climbing out of the truck, Rebekah grabbed her gear and began looking. It didn\u2019t take long, to her amazement, to find the box, but it took longer than she wanted to dig it up. And she hid more than once as another vehicle passes by.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The box was made of pine. It was old and covered in dirt. The front latch and hinges showed signs of wear, but seemed in good condition. Inside the box were 13 gold coins \u2014baker\u2019s dozen \u2014 and a note. The note read:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Rebekah,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for taking a chance and looking for the box. You will need to take it and go because the police will arrive in less than 10 minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go to the jeweler in town \u2014 not, I repeat, not to the pawn shop. There you will get a fair price. Trade in the coins and open a checking account. You should get at least $20,000. Use it wisely. Then get a plane ticket and go to Le Procope. Order a Big Mac. They will know what to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Love Always,<br>Charles<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rebekah tossed and turned, but finally fell asleep just after midnight. Finally, after waking up several times, Rebekah drove to the university to let her colleges and students know that she would be out of town for \u201ca few days\u201d. Then she drove to town to sell twelve of the coins and after getting $19,875, went on to open a checking account, complete with debit card. \u201cNext stop,\u201d she told herself, \u201cParis.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s never as easy as you would hope to travel internationally. There\u2019s not only the ticket, but L\u2019h\u00f4tel and, oh yes, a passport. Fortunately, Rebekah was able to book a late flight for less than $700 and be on her way. During that time, Rebekah was able to finish the semester with her students before leaving \u2014 just after Christmas. She brought one gold coin and the Bible that she had found in her classroom, along with enough clean clothes for a week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chapter 2 When in Paris<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you ever have the chance to visit Paris, do. But never sing the words to the song that go: \u201cVoulez-vous voucher avec moi?,\u201d unless you want others to laugh at you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lesson Learned. It took about 45 minutes to get from the airport to the hotel, and another 15 minutes to check in and for Rebekah to make it to her room on the second floor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few hours later, Rebekah woke up. It was time for dinner, so she got up, spruced up a little and headed to Le Procope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat do you mean you want a Big Mac,\u201d demanded the waiter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rebekah was certain that the whole thing had been a big mistake when the waiter arrived with yet another letter and a bowl of soup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll like this soup,\u201d said the waiter. \u201cIt\u2019s a house special.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rebekah tasted the soup \u2014 French onion \u2014 opened the letter and began reading.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Rebekah,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t know how to explain this, but I hope you will trust me. And day, after class, I found a small package on my front steps. It was from my father. I never knew my father. He disappeared when I was just two.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside was a time piece \u2014 a pocket watch \u2014 and 26 pieces of gold. I opened it up and nothing happened. But I found another latch and, when I opened it up, I was suddenly taken to 1792, where I\u2019ve been for the past month. These letters are the only way I knew how to reach you. If you can figure out where I am, you can bring me home. If not, I will be stuck here till I die.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know you will do what is right. Know that I love you very much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Love Always,<br>Charles<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PS: Go to the library and find \u201cHomer\u2019s Iliad\u201d. I\u2019ve arranged for a man to translate for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Rebekah to herself. \u201cBien.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chapter 3 The Biblioth\u00e8que<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the Paris library stood a 50ish year old man holding the sign, \u201cRebekah\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAre you my translator,\u201d asked Rebekah?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOui,\u201d said the man. \u201cI mean, jes.\u201d He continued, \u201cIt looks like it could snow. We should probably go inside.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two stepped inside. \u201cMy name is Michael,\u201d said the man. \u201cHow long will you be in town,\u201d he asked?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rebekah followed Micheal to a table and after saying something in French, Michael was handed a book. The two went upstairs and found a quiet place where Michael could read out loud to Rebekah. As he read, he translated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michel read to Rebekah for the next five days, reading quickly and skipping some parts \u2014 12 hours, until he had finished the book. Rebekah took notes as Michel read.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBe strong, saith my heart; I am a soldier; I have seen worse sights than this.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou, why are you so afraid of war and slaughter? Even if all the rest of us drop and die around you, grappling for the ships, you\u2019d run no risk of death: you lack the heart to last it out in combat\u2014coward!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe proud heart feels not terror nor turns to run and it is his own courage that kills him.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cLike a girl, a baby running after her mother, begging to be picked up, and she tugs on her skirts, holding her back as she tries to hurry off\u2014all tears, fawning up at her, till she takes her in her arms\u2026 That\u2019s how you look, Patroclus, streaming live tears.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBut listen to me first and swear an oath to use all your eloquence and strength to look after me and protect me.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBut listen to me first and swear an oath to use all your eloquence and strength to look after me and protect me.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWait,\u201d said Rebekah, \u201cread that, again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBut listen to me first and swear an oath to use all your eloquence and strength to look after me and protect me.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNone of it makes sense,\u201d said Rebekah, as Michael finished reading. \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael stood and walked away, returning with a small book. \u201cThey gave me this,\u201d said Michale. \u201cIt\u2019s called, \u201cThe Last Lines of Andr\u00e9 Ch\u00e9nier.\u201d As Michel began to translate, he read these words:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs a last gentle breeze, as the sun\u2019s waning fire<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEnliven the end of the day,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAwaiting the gallows, again, I try my lyer.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s him,\u201d exclaimed Rebekah. \u201cI remember Charles saying those words. \u201cThat\u2019s him. Somehow he got Ch\u00e9nier to write those words. I just know it.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHow much longer do you have in Paris,\u201d asked Micheal, \u201cbefore you have to go back to America?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTomorrow,\u201d replied Rebekah. \u201cI fly back home Friday.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s just enough time,\u201d said Michel. \u201cYou need to see Paris before you leave.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe Eiffel Tower,\u201d asked Rebekah?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d answered Michael. \u201cNo, you need to see the real Paris.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chapter 4 The Real Paris<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sound of the phone ringing woke Rebekah from her sleep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI hope I didn\u2019t wake you,\u201d said Michael.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Rebekah, sounding a little groggy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Michael. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cReady to see Paris.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI need about an hour,\u201d replied Rebekah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d said Michael. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you in the hotel lobby.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rebekah began getting ready and, after a shower, put on her makeup and a red dress that went down to her ankles. It took just over an hour to get ready, but Rebekah felt that the time was well worth it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d said Rebekah, as she met Michael in the lobby.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d replied Michael. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind me bringing my children.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cChildren?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMy girls,\u201d said Michael. \u201cSarah is seven and Maddie is five. They\u2019re both very sweet and won\u2019t get in the way.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Rebekah, still a little sleepy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTheir mother\u2026,\u201d replied Michael.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s at work?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d answered Michael. \u201cShe\u2026. How you say? She died.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Sarah. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. And I\u2019ve been keeping you from your family.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. The girls stayed with their grandma-ma. They love her. Their father left after their mother died. I am their grandpa.\u201d Michael added, \u201cHave you had breakfast?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah shook her head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNo? We will have to stop at a store.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael and Rebekah climbed into Michael&#8217;s 1993 BMW where Sarah and Maddie sat in the back seat. Then the two took off down the road.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFirst stop,\u201d said Michael, \u201cCarrefour Market.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a short drive. Michael parked on the street and the four went inside. \u201cBe good, girls,\u201d Michael told Sarah and Maddie.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe will pa-pa.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carrefour Market could have been an art museum, thought Rebekah. Everything from the produce to the bottles of wine was simply gorgeous.<br>\u201cWe\u2019ll get bacon from the deli and eggs,\u201d said Michael. \u201cI like English bacon. We\u2019ll also get something for dinner.\u201d<br>It took about fifteen minutes to get everything and another ten minutes in line to pay for it. Then there was a twenty minute ride back to Michael\u2019s and Willow\u2019s flat.<br>Willow was a charming woman, a few years older than Michael. Deep black hair and lovely hazel eyes, she stood just 5\u2019, but with such amazing character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI love your home,\u201d said Rebekah.<br>\u201cThank you,\u201d blushed Willow, in replay.<br>\u201cMaddie and Sarah told me all about you on our drive here.\u201d<br>\u201cThey are my life,\u201d said Willow. \u201cMichael, too,\u201d she added, kissing Michael on the cheek.<br>Michael and Rebekah sat on apposing chairs in the dining room while Willow and the girls made breakfast.<br>\u201cWhat is it that you are trying to do,\u201d asked Michael.<br>\u201cThe short answer is that I am looking for a friend,\u201d answered Rebekah.<br>He is special,\u201d asked Michael.<br>\u201cQuite,\u201d replied Rebekah.<br>It took about twenty minutes for breakfast to be ready and the girls helped bring plates in to the dining room table before all sat down. Michael prayed.<br>\u201cHeavenly Father,<br>Bless this food we are about to eat. Thank you for Rebekah, Sarah, Maddie and especially for Willow.<br>Amen\u201d<br>\u201cThis looks amazing,\u201d said Rebekah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d replied Willow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEverything looks amazing.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe girls will stay here with Willow while we paint the town yellow,\u201d said Michael.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou mean red,\u201d asked Rebekah?<br>\u201cNo,\u201d said Michael. \u201cI paint the streets, and today I am using yellow.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Rebekah, a little shocked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis way,\u201d said Michael, you will get to see what Persians are really like. And you can help me by holding the paint can.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGood, then,\u201d said Rebekah. \u201cI can hardly wait.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The five finished breakfast and Michael and Willow kissed before Michael and Rebekah headed off to paint the streets of Paris.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a part time job,\u201d said Michael, after parking in one of the cities parking lots. \u201cI\u2019ll work just four hours, today.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was cold out, but Michael gave Rebekah his coat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHere you go, lovely,\u201d he said, as he handed Rebekah the leather jacket that he had worn for some 25 years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThank you, Michael,\u201d said Rebekah, picking up and holding the can of paint, making sure to not get any paint on Michael\u2019s jacket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The work took just over four hours, with a fifteen minute break in the middle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat time is your flight,\u201d asked Micheal, as the two sat on the curb?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEight AM,\u201d said Rebekah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI will take you to the airport. The girls will probably want to go along for the ride.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI would love to see them, again,\u201d said Rebekah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou will,\u201d replied Micheal. \u201cYou\u2019ll see them this evening.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a little past noon, Michael and Rebekah climbed into Michael\u2019s car and took off, stopping in near a cosy little cafe for cucumber sandwiches and tea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI learned my English while studying at Oxford,\u201d explained Michael.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDid you graduate,\u201d asked Rebekah?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSadly, no,\u201d said Michael.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d said Rebekah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEnough about me, said Michel, \u201ctell me about yourself.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI grew up in Chelsea, MA, and attended Boston College,\u201d said Rebekah. \u201cI got my bachelors in basket weaving,\u201d she said, joking, and my masters in world literature.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael laughed. \u201cI got my degree from the city of Paris. They handed my an apron and said \u2018Congratulations, you\u2019re a painter.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSounds fun,\u201d said Rebekah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat did you learn,\u201d asked Michael, \u201cwhen you worked with me?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThat the French are a lot more patient than Americans.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnd?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPainting is harder than I thought,\u201d added Rebekah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After lunch, the two climbed back into Michael\u2019s car and stopped at a hardware \u201cmuseum\u201d for a fresh pale of paint.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then they found a quiet park and, parking the car, found a quiet park bench and fed the pigeons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two hardly spoke, but for an hour, they just enjoyed each other\u2019s company. Then they climbed back into the car and headed to Michael\u2019s flat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rebekah spent an hour and a half playing hide and seek with Sarah and Maddie, while Willow made dinner. When it was nearly five in the evening, the lot of them ate dinner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt seems that Rebekah is quite the painter,\u201d said Michael.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Rebekah, \u201cbut I couldn\u2019t have done it without Michael.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSo,\u201d asked Willow,\u201d what brings you to Paris, if you don\u2019t mind me asking?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for a friend.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a friend in Boston,\u201d she asked?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to find clues that my friend, Charles, left behind.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Willow. \u201cSounds complicated.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cVery,\u201d said Rebekah. \u201cBut Michael has been such a huge help.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The girls got ready for bed, bathing and getting dresses in their pajamas before grandpa-pa read to them. Maddie sat on grand\u2019s lap while Sarah sat on Rebekah\u2019s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt all began one day when\u2026,\u201d read Michael, so the story goes. \u201cAnd they all lived happily ever after.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chapter 5 No \u201cThe End\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael and the girls arrived and picked up Rebekah from her hotel, driving her to the airport.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWill you have anyone waiting for you when you get back home,\u201d asked Sarah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNo, sweetie,\u201d said Sarah. \u201cI\u2019ll hale a taxi.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Sarah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When they arrived at the airport, Rebekah hugged Michael and gave the girls each a kiss on the cheek. \u201cThank you for everything,\u201d she said, waving goodbye until the BMW was out of sight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The flight home seemed longer than the flight to Paris. As much as Rebekah had enjoyed her stay in Paris, she was anxious to see Charles, again. Unfortunately, it would have to wait till the start of the spring semester.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Sarah returned to her class, instead of Charles, Rebekah found another letter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Rebekah,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great job. But it seems that I\u2019m still not back home. Instead, I\u2019ve traveled to the year 1805.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I cannot tell you anything more at this time. Just know that I love you and will write more when I can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Love Always,<br>Charles\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Chapter 1 Letters Charles swept a small pile of dirt into a dustpan and carefully threw it into a waste basket in the front of the class. \u201cCharles,\u201d said a warm, feminine voice at the back of the class. \u201cCharles,\u201d repeated Rebekah, as she stood&nbsp;<a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/letters-from-a-time-travel-charles-and-rebekah\">&hellip;<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":962,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[73,72],"tags":[3],"class_list":["post-961","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-fiction","category-letters-from-a-time-traveler","tag-llgt"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/961","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=961"}],"version-history":[{"count":2,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/961\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":964,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/961\/revisions\/964"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/962"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=961"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=961"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=961"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
