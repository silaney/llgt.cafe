But I also pray that you find the power to move forward into the New Year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesus promised that those who follow him will find their strength in him and in the Holy Spirit. Those who put their faith in Jesus not only have the hope that he will be with us in this life, but that the Holy Spirit will be with us and will continue to guide us in the way we should go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many, including myself, who are looking for Jesus to return. No, I don\u2019t know when that will be. But I can hope that it will be soon. Until that time, I move forward. Like a baby learning to walk, I fall, and I fail. But I learn from my mistakes. Jesus \u2014 God \u2014 picks me up and holds my hand as I try, again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I pray that you, too, find God\u2019s love. He doesn\u2019t hide it. It\u2019s just that we cannot see it if our eyes are on this world: the worries, the temptations and the things that we believe we lack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My prayer is that you will find what you are looking for \u2014 not under the Christmas tree, but in Christ, the one who willingly gave his so that we might live hanging on another tree. It was because he loves you \u2014 not so he could come back and take his vengeance out on us all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t know what next year holds. I cannot say that I even know what the rest of the year holds. My plans won\u2019t stand up to what God has in store for those who love him. My prayer for you is that you will trust God is he wants to change your plans. I pray that, in him, you will find your power.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At a time when winter has not only buied much of the United States in ice and snow, it has also left many people without power.
