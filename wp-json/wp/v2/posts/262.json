On the other hand, it\u2019s been said that it\u2019s not without reason that advertisers are willing to spend $5 million for 30 seconds of advertising during the Super Bowl.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The things that we watch, and the things that we hear can affect our emotions. Perhaps we don\u2019t consciously hear the negative words, but our subconscious does, and the part of our brains that controls our subconscious behavior is much more powerful than the part that controls our conscious mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, hearing the same thing over and over may be a form of brainwashing. Instead of hearing and understanding different points of view, we become more and more convinced that our own way is right, and if someone disagrees with us, they are obviously wrong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is plenty of positive music to choose from. If you want to keep up with what\u2019s going on in the world, there is a wide variety of choices. Even the thoughts that we tell ourselves; we can choose to focus on the positive instead of the negative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don\u2019t have to live in denial in order to see the good in bad situations. It helps to keep in mind, however, that negative news and negative comments carry much more weight in our mind than good news.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Philippians 4:8 (KJV) says, \u201cFinally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may not be good enough to try to remove negative thoughts. The things that we think about continually become a habit, and we don\u2019t really get rid of old habits just by willing them away; they have to be replaced by new habits, and this take time. It takes at least 30 days to form a new habit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are you thinking about right now? Is it negative or positive? You can change what you think about. Consider what listen to, what you watch on TV or what you read. And pay special attention to the words that come out of your own mouth. The life that you change may be your own.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s been argued that the music that someone listens to doesn\u2019t really affect him, or that it\u2019s not the words but the beat she likes.
