While Adobe offers some of the best software, it can also be some of the most frustrating.&nbsp; Presently, I\u2019m trying to get my computer connected to the internet, but its being very trying. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Love is so important; it should be included in the list of things that we need in order to survive.&nbsp; Like water, air and shelter, love might just be key to survival.&nbsp; And though it may not be necessary for every individual, it is for the survival of the human race. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, we can survive without love, but we cannot thrive without it.&nbsp; And though we can just survive, the better option is to thrive. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can we find love if and when we are alone?&nbsp; I think so.&nbsp; Why, you may ask? &nbsp; Or, how?&nbsp; It\u2019s simple.&nbsp; If you can find someone else who needs love and, if you are willing to be open and vulnerable, you can find love. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First Corinthians 13 reminds us that, if we don\u2019t have love, our actions, our very lives are useless.&nbsp; For the Bible tells us that God, Himself, is love.&nbsp; We love because He first loved us. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If love is so important, how do we find it?&nbsp; First, search for God.&nbsp; You can \u201cask Him into your heart.\u201d&nbsp; It\u2019s kind of like giving God your heart.&nbsp; God already owns everything.&nbsp; We just have to surrender our will to His. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, we can decide to meet others where they are.&nbsp; Activity look to help others, meeting then where they are and not where we wish they were.&nbsp; God met us where we were when He sent Jesus to die on a cross.&nbsp; We meet Him when we accept His gift.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Trying to get tech to work can seem like getting a three year old to clean up his room.&nbsp; Yet, tech doesn\u2019t have the advantage of being loved, which makes it all the more frustrating when we can\u2019t get it to do what we want.&nbsp;<a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/finding-love-in-the-right-places\">&hellip;<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":920,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[26,25,51,71,47,14],"tags":[8,7,3],"class_list":["post-919","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-emotions","category-faith","category-personal-growth","category-personal-stories","category-relational","category-spiritual","tag-god","tag-jesus","tag-llgt"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/919","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=919"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/919\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":921,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/919\/revisions\/921"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/920"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=919"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=919"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=919"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
