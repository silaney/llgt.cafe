I used to wonder if I could structure such a business. I wonder a lot of things, and like all of the others, it hasn\u2019t happened yet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is, it seems, a county, somewhere, that is doing something similar. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s too much for one person to do. Yet, there are business that are helping others while they (hopefully) make a profit. They aren\u2019t asking for donations. Still, they are able to help others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One such organization is COL1972, who gives part of its profits to help expectant mothers. They help save lives. You can read more about COL1972 in the <a href=\"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/April-2023-issue-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">April 2023 edition<\/a> of LLGT Cafe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom\u2019s Shoes has long been dedicated to producing quality shoes. Their commitment is to donate one pair of shoos for every pair of shoes purchased. Tom\u2019s is also investing in their local community and, according to their website, they have helped over a million individuals since 2006.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tacos 4 Life has a similar strategy. For every meal that is purchased, they are able to provide one meal through another organization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I heard of one restaurant that gave customers the opportunity to pay it forward by purchasing slices of pizza for others. A customer could buy a ticket and that ticket would be placed on a bulletin board for anyone who could not afford to buy their own pizza.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don\u2019t have to own a business to do good. There are countless charities that we can donate to. We can choose to support expedient mothers, we can help organizations like the Arbor Day Foundation, we can help children through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.compassion.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Compassion International<\/a>, or we can hand $20 to the cashier at Starbucks to pay it forward for the next customer that comes along.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing is clear. Life can be hard. Some times we need help and we shouldn\u2019t have to go at it alone.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I used to wonder if an someone could build a group of businesses that work together to support a ministry that helps the homeless \u2014 and do so without having to ask for donations.
