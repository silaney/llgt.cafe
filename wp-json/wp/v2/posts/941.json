If it\u2019s not work and paying the bills, it\u2019s something else: taking care of others, or just living life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Staying busy can help pass the time, and help us to forget that our lives may have not turned out exactly as we had hoped. But it can also keep us from discovering some of the more important things that matter not only in this life but in eternity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gospel of Luke tells us a story of how Martha wanted Jesus to tell Mary to help with the meal preparations.

Opportunities lost may not come around a second time, so it\u2019s important to use the opportunities that we have wisely. Staying busy can be a good thing, but don\u2019t exchange good for what\u2019s best.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It seems that there is always something that can keep us busy.
