In the USA, the holiday was first celebrated in California and has become associated with Mexican-American culture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The holiday grew in popularity when, in the 1980s, alcohol companies began to advertise the holiday. But there is more to Cinco de Mayo than beer, wine and tequila. And a good Cinco de Mayo party should have lots of food.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mol\u00e9 is a key ingredient in several Mexican dishes. It is sauce that begins with chilis, tomato and spices. There are several variations, with at least one with chocolate added. Preparation depends on the style of mol\u00e9 that is being made.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tamales are another iconic Mexican dish. Tamales are two separate recipes \u2014 the meat, which can be beef or pork \u2014 and the corn paste that the meat is cooked in. Usually the paste is spread into a dried corn husk, a small amount of meat is added, and the tamales are folded into the corn husk before steaming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fish Tacos became popular in the 50s and 60s in some costal areas in Mexico \u2014 around the same time that Cinco de Mayo was gaining popularity in the US. Fish tacos are similar to other tacos, with the exception of the meat used. And you can make them as simple or as complex as you like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other thing. If you want to host a Cinco de Mayo party, don\u2019t forget the music. If you can\u2019t find a local radio station with Mexican music, you should be able to find some online and, likely, on a smartphone. And don\u2019t forget the guacamole.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Need help figuring out what to make? Here are some cookbooks that you can download from Amazon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/42qRldF\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screen-Shot-2023-05-05-at-12.08.50-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-789\" width=\"256\" height=\"322\" srcset=\"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screen-Shot-2023-05-05-at-12.08.50-PM.png 518w, https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screen-Shot-2023-05-05-at-12.08.50-PM-238x300.png 238w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3VB0hL7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screen-Shot-2023-05-05-at-12.10.53-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-790\" width=\"274\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screen-Shot-2023-05-05-at-12.10.53-PM.png 528w, https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screen-Shot-2023-05-05-at-12.10.53-PM-243x300.png 243w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/44BplpI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screen-Shot-2023-05-05-at-12.11.59-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-791\" width=\"277\" height=\"344\" srcset=\"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screen-Shot-2023-05-05-at-12.11.59-PM.png 526w, https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/Screen-Shot-2023-05-05-at-12.11.59-PM-241x300.png 241w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 277px) 100vw, 277px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>First observed in 1863, Cinco de Mayo is the celebration of the victory of Mexico over France in the Battle of Puebla the previous year.
