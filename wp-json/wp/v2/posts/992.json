July 13 is Gruntled Workers Day. To be disgruntled is to be angry or dissatisfied. Gruntled, on the other hand, means to be pleased, satisfied, or contented.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This holiday is designed for workers, but you can celebrate this holiday in you own way whether you are able to work or not, whether you are self employed or working for someone else, or even if you are retired.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main thing is that we want to be satisfied with what we are doing. We want to feel that there is purpose in what we do and that the work we do is appreciated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are having trouble being happy at work, here are a few ideas that may help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try hiding or covering the clock. Constantly checking the clock can not only slow down your work but can also make the time seem as though it is passing more slowly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have done something well, and are happy with your work, find some way to reward yourself. It could be something as simple as a small cheer that you say to yourself, or flowers that you buy and put in your work place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Listen to music if allowed. You can put together a playlist of your favorite songs and, as long as it isn\u2019t bothering someone else, it may help the day pass by more quickly and more enjoyably.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start or end the day by thinking of at least five people or things that you are thankful for. It could be the place where you work, someone that you work with, or a new tool that you got to help you with your work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look for ways to help co-workers. Helping a boss or someone look good in front of peers is a good place to start, but there are other ways that you can help others where you work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try asking questions that help you to grow in you work-related knowledge. Make sure you are asking the right person and not someone who might have good intentions but might unwittingly lead you in the wrong direction. Also, when you ask a question, make sure that you are really listening to the answer and not trying to come up with your next question.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember the value that you add to your work place, and remind others of the value that they add. You don\u2019t have to be a supervisor to tell others that they are doing a good job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along the same lines, let others know that you appreciate them. If at all possible, learn your co-workers names and say their names whenever you see them. Get to know your co-workers, and as them about things that matter to them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plan a vacation or a special event. If can be something that you plan to do in the near future, or it can be something that you add to your bucket list. Having something to look forward to will go a long way to help you brighten your outlook on life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, if you have done all that you can and still aren\u2019t happy, it may be time to start looking for another job. There is only so much that you can do, if you have truly tried everything that you know to do and still are not happy, it may be time to work on your resume and start looking elsewhere. You may find that you are happier and may even be able to earn more money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other thing. If you find yourself at a store or a restaurant, and you have been served by someone else, remember to thank him or her for her service. Let him or her know that you appreciate the hard work that they do. Service work, along with a list of other jobs, is often under appreciated and the service worker is more likely to hear a complain that a compliment. Being thankful for the things that others do for you is something that you can do every day. You don\u2019t need to wait for that one day out of the year.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Here\u2019s one you may want to plan ahead for. July 13 is Gruntled Workers Day.
