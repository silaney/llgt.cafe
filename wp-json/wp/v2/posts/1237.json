It was on how we should approach God in prayer: with boldness and with confidence. We can approach God with boldness because of what Jesus has done on our behalf and we can approach God with confidence because of who God is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I managed to go for a walk this morning. Now, it\u2019s too hot and I don\u2019t really want to go anywhere. I just got back from church and had baby bok choy. I\u2019m supposed to meet Colin for burgers for dinner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I made it to the gym a few days last week. One day I had intended to go, I wound up coming home to unplug something that I had intended to unplug before leaving for work. Oops.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Olympics are in full swing. I\u2019m not sure who might have one something. It seems that there is a lot of hype when it comes to local businesses that doesn\u2019t come to fruition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday, I had baked salmon and cauliflower with sliced lemon on top. I seared both with avocado oil and butter on medium heat before putting them both \u2014 in a cast iron skillet \u2014 in to an oven, preheated to 35o degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes. It was so good, I could hardly wait for it to cool down before starting to eat it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>God, I pray that You would enter the hearts of man that the world could find the only source of peace, which is Your Son: Jesus Christ. Thank You for loving me. Thank You for Your Word, the Bible. Thank You for my friend, Lily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Jesus\u2019 name,<br>Amen<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dear Diary,The teaching at church was from Matthew 7.
