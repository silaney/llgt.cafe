Her stream of income ended, while the bills continued to roll in. Then the creditors began to write, and they weren\u2019t love letters. It\u2019s strange what super powers that tragedy will give you and, for me, the ability to say no was mine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ability to say no, not only to other but to ourselves, is a powerful tool in the life of an entrepreneur. That is because saying \u201cno\u201d to even the good things frees us up say \u201cyes\u201d to the best things. But it\u2019s not an easy choice to make, and I had to learn the hard way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019a a lesson that I\u2019m still learning to put into practice: at lest saying \u201cno\u201d to myself, especially to myself. But I\u2019m working on it. I could blame the ease of credit cards, or marketing and advertising that seems to fill nearly every moment of our waking lives. Yet, I\u2019m the one who must ultimately has to take responsibility of my choices, and no one else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it\u2019s hard lesson to learn, but it\u2019s really never to late. And it\u2019s never too late to change, as long as you believe that you can.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are several things that I was not fortunate to learn as a child, and one of them was the meaning of the two letter word: \u201cNo.\u201d And, admittedly, I\u2019m still learning.
