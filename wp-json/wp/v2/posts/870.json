People who believe that they are going to die by a particular age because all of the men in their family died by that age often die when they expected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of what we see and hear on television, especially the news, is negative. Bad news can negatively affect our emotions and our emotions can, at times, affect our health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you watch, what do you listen to, and what are some of the things that you say? These are pretty good indications of what you are thinking about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we think we\u2019re too busy or cannot afford to eat healthy meals, we won\u2019t. If we put garbage into our minds, that\u2019s likely what our lives will produce. And if we are not careful, our own words may have a negative impact on our health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Philippians 4:8 (KJV) tells us, \u201cFinally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It takes self control to control the things that we put into our mind. It also takes self control to control the things that we put into our bodies and the things that come out of our mouth. Jesus warned the multitudes in Matthew 15 that it was our words that can defile us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be careful what you listen to. There\u2019s more than enough bad news and you don\u2019t have to look hard to find it. There is also more than enough fast food for the mind. It may not always be possible to block all of the negative thoughts, but we can fill our lives with as much as we can. It\u2019s something to think about.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I came across a quote online that says, \u201cYour diet is not only what you eat.\u201d What it\u2019s saying is that our health isn\u2019t affected just by the for that we put into our bodies but also everything that we we watch, hear, read or&nbsp;<a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/as-a-man-woman-thinks\">&hellip;<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":871,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[70,14],"tags":[5,3],"class_list":["post-870","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-lifestyle","category-spiritual","tag-king-james-bible","tag-llgt"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/870","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=870"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/870\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":872,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/870\/revisions\/872"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/871"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=870"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=870"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=870"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
