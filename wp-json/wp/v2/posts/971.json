One of the first things that we learn is our name. Another thing that we learn is our relationship with others. Later, we learn what we are good at, what we enjoy and what we enjoy doing, as well as how to relate to others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are some things that we may have to unlearn about ourselves. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019ve spent much of my life seeing myself the way others see me. I\u2019m \u201cnot good enough,\u201d not, \u201csmart enough,\u201d and I\u2019m \u201cslow.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could see myself as being 57 years old or 57 years young. I could see myself as having X number of friends. I could see myself as having a certain amount of money in my bank account. But how does God see me, and what does the Bible say?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The book of Psalms tells me that I am fearfully and wonderfully made. The New Testament tells me that God loved me \u2014 loved us \u2014 enough to send His son to die on a cross so that I might have an eternal relationship with Him. The Bible tells me that that I\u2019m of greater value than many sparrows, which God cares for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it\u2019s up to me. Do I choose to see myself as others see me \u2014 as I often see myself? Or, do I choose to believe what God\u2019s Word says \u2014 how God sees me? We all have this choice.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What do we know about ourselves? One of the first things that we learn is our name.
