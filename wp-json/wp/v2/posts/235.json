But, instead of spending all of your money on expensive gifts or, worse yet, going deeper into debt, you may consider ways you can use your time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Volunteer<\/strong><br>You, or you and your family can do volunteer work. It\u2019s a great way to help others, and can be a lot of fun. Volunteer work can range from working in a local soup kitchen to singing in a retirement community. Churches are also packed during the Christmas season and may need help with parking, greeting, or in the nursery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Games<\/strong><br>Board games can be a great way of spending more time together. If not board games, there are other games that can work, depending on the age range of those playing. There are hundreds of games to choose from, and many of them are free, or cost very little.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bake<\/strong><br>Baking can be a lot of fun, if done right. Baked goods can be given as gifts or even sold at farmer\u2019s markets or county fairs, and this money could be used to buy gifts next year. Selling these baked goods can even be a way for the children to earn their own Christmas money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Save<\/strong><br>Another way to use our time is to start saving, now, for next year\u2019s Christmas presents. It\u2019s far better to have the money set aside for those holiday season bargains. Even if we get 50% off of an item, it\u2019s not a bargain if we pay for it on credit and are still paying for it two years from now. We would be much better saving up over the year, instead of making payments for things that we\u2019ve already bought.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With just sixteen days till Christmas, there may still be time to find savings on Christmas gifts.
