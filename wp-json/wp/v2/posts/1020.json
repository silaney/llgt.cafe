It\u2019s one of those deeper questions that we ask ourselves from time to time. And we may get a different answer each time.<br>I\u2019m not entirely sure who I am. In short, I\u2019m Ralph. I know who I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not the things I own, the people I know or the things that I have done. These things may help shape me, but they don\u2019t make me who I am. Another thing I am not: I am not what I was and I am not yet who I will be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was 14 when I asked Jesus to be lord of my life, which was 43 years ago. After hearing the Gospel, I realized that I was a sinner and that God had sent His Son to die on a cross so that I might have eternal life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I was so shy at the time, I couldn\u2019t pray out loud. That has certainly changed. I\u2019m no longer shy about praying out loud and some times as others if I can pray with and for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone can become a follower of Jesus. We don\u2019t have to live a particular lifestyle. We just need to have faith that Jesus can save us from our sins. Really, He is the only one who can. I cannot save myself from my sins. I put my faith in Jesus and God gave me eternal life. He also gave me the Holy Spirit to help guild me. If you like, you could say I\u2019m born again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What else is true? I am loved. I am fearfully and wonderfully made. I am a child of the living God. How about you? John 3:16 (KJV) says that, \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d Are you a whosoever? I\u2019m a whosoever.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Who am I? It\u2019s one of those deeper questions that we ask ourselves from time to time.
