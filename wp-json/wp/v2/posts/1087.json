I, myself, being born in 1966 don\u2019t remember anything of it until the early 70\u2019s. Little that I remember is still the same. Most of the buildings in what used to be the center of town have been replaced, with the exception of \u201cThe Old Post Office\u201d and a few shops. And what used to be a shop is now a bank.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think part of what makes this area so unique is the strong presence of the faith that has been handed down from previous generations. And, while not all churches continue to grow, there are a few that thrive and flourish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, Northwest Arkansas doesn\u2019t have the beauty of the Rocky Mountains, and you won\u2019t find the beauty of a California sunrise, but it does have it\u2019s own beauty and charm, along with it\u2019s southern hospitality. And, while some of the major cities along the coast have lost some of their charm, it is not so with what I call home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it\u2019s not quite the same as the place I grew up in, Northwest Arkansas still has it\u2019s charms. For the most part, the people are still friendly \u2014 still willing to lend a hand. And you don\u2019t have to look long to find a good church home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, it\u2019s not California or New York, but I think that\u2019s a good thing. If you move here, I hope you enjoy it. I hope you call this area home. But wherever you find yourself, remember that it\u2019s family that makes a home.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s hard to believe all of the changes that have come to Northwest Arkansas since my family moved here in 1965.
