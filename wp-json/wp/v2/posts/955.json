The term describes a dry heat cooing method that uses some sort of flame to cook meats over a long period of time. Barbecues very from campfire cooking in that the flame is usually contained to a grill, and the food is cooked directly over the flame.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Baste<\/strong><br>Brushing liquid such as drippings or other liquids on the meat as it cooks is called basting, and helps keep the meat from drying out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Basting Brush<\/strong><br>A basing brush is a bush used to baste meats. You want something designed for food use that will not loose its bristles on the food.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Black and Blue<\/strong><br>Meat that is cooked quickly, charring the meat on the outside while leaving it rare the inside, is called black and blue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brochette<\/strong><br>The French term for kabob, food cooked on a skewer, is a brochette.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Burn Pot<\/strong><br>A burn pot is where the wood pellets ignite and produce the heat and smoke.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Drip Pan<\/strong><br>A drip pan is a metal or disposable foil pan that is placed under food to catch drippings when grilling. A drip pan can also be made from aluminum foil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Charcoal Briquettes<\/strong><br>Compacted ground charcoal, coal dust, and starch are used to form briquettes that are used as fuel in charcoal grills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Charcoal Grill<\/strong><br>A grill that is designed for use with charcoal, rather than gas or wood pellets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fat Cap<\/strong><br>The fat cap is the thick layer of fat between the meat and the skin. The meat should be placed so that the fat cap is in top, allowing the fat to run down the meat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fire Box<\/strong><br>The fire box is the bottom part of the grill that holds the fire or heat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gas Grill<\/strong><br>A gas grill is a grill that is designed to use either propane or natural gas. These grills are easier to use than other types of grills and they heat up faster, but may not give meats the same flavor as other types of grills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grill<\/strong><br>The place where you are cooking your barbecue, and the process of barbecuing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kabobs<\/strong><br>Pieces of meat, poultry, seafood, and\/or vegetables, threaded on a skewer and grilled are called kabobs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lump Charcoal<\/strong><br>Carbon residue of wood that has been charred, usually in the form of lumps, is called lump charcoal. It is used as the heat source in charcoal grills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marinade<\/strong><br>A marinade is a liquid that helps tenderize meats or adds flavor to meats. Marinades are made from a wide variety of liquids including soy sauce, wine or fruit juice, and often contain fresh or dried herbs and\/or spices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marinate<\/strong><br>To marinate is the process of using a marinade on the meat before cooking it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mop<\/strong><br>A mop is a thin, usually vinegar based sauce (like BBQ sauce) that is basted on a piece of meat while it\u2019s cooking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rub<\/strong><br>Rubs are either of the wet or dry variety and are full of spices, herbs and seasonings that enhance the flavor of the food you are cooking. Rubs can either be rubbed on the meat or just sprinkled on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Skewer<\/strong><br>A skewer is a metal or wood stick that us used to hold small pieces of meat, seafood or vegetables for cooking on a grill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Smoke<\/strong><br>Meats can be smoked for a couple of reason. First, it can be done to help preserve the meat. Second, it can be done to impart a smoky flavor to the meat. If you are just smoking and not cooking, cheeses can also be smoked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tenderize<\/strong><br>Tougher costs of meat can be tenderized to make them easier to eat. Mechanical tenderizing means using something like a hammer to break up the fibers of the meat, while certain tenderizers can do the same thing, but may take longer. Mango is one thing that will tenderize meats, but be careful not to leave the meat in too long, or it could fall apart before you even get it to the grill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wood Chips<\/strong><br>Natural wood chips can be added to a fire to impart a smoky flavor to food as it cooks. Alder, apple, cherry, hickory, maple, mesquite, and oak are some of the more popular wood chips that can be used. Often, they are soaked in a liquid to keep them from boring too quickly. The wood chips can also be soaked in a liquid, like a brine or a simple syrup, that may impart its own flavor to the food.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wood Pellets<\/strong><br>Wood pellets are used in socially designed grills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you learned something new. This may not be a complete list of the terms used in barbecuing. Perhaps you have some of your own to add to the list.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>July 4 is National Barbecue Day, and there\u2019s no better time to learn some of the terms that pit-masters (people skilled in the art of cooking in a barbecue pit) use.
