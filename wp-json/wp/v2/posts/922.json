One might think that it would be easier to remember to praise God when things are going well. But I find that it\u2019s easier to remember when things aren\u2019t going as I would want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>God is worthy of praise. It has nothing to do with my being worthy to praise God.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The book of Psalm is one of my favorite books in the Bible. Much of the book is praise to God, and much of it was written in times of distress. Below are just a few.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u201cBless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.\u201d \u2014Psalm 103:1<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u201cBecause thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee. Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.\u201d Psalm 63:3-4<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u201cI will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.\u201d \u2014 Psalm 145:1<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jesus\u2019 decibels asked the Lord how they ought to pray. Jesus starts off a prayer saying, \u201c\u2026Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.\u201d Matthew 6:9. God is set apart. Unlike his creation, God cannot lie and he cannot sin. God is holy, and we need to remember this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Isaiah 25: 1 says, <strong>\u201cO Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Praising God likely won\u2019t change our circumstances, but it has the power to change how we see our circumstances. It can help us take our eyes off of the problems that we face and put them on the one who is bigger than our problems. It\u2019s something that I need to remember to do more often.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have to admit, I don\u2019t often think to praise God as I should.
