It\u2019s as if to say, \u201cGod, we need you now.\u201d I find that, these days, I never stop needing God. I need him all of the time, whether I am conscious of my need or not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today is Never Give Up Day. It is a worldwide holiday aimed at helping individuals who are suffering from various forms of pain and grief. It is meant as an encouragement us to not give up and keep on going.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today is also National Fajita Day as well as National Ice Cream Pie Day. And if I had known about either one of these in advance, I might have been better prepared to celebrate. Maybe next year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lord,<br>Help me to not give up, but to do it because I know that you are with me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Help those who have suffered loss. Be with them and encourage them as they face yet another day with whatever it is they are suffering. Thank you that, as long as we are alive, you never give up on us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>May ever day be a day to celebrate because of what Jesus has done on the cross: redeeming me and giving me a future that is better and brighter that I can ever imagine.
