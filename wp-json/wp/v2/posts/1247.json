The place where I work compensates part of the monthly membership fee. If you are interested in joining a gym, perhaps the place you work does the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working out has been interesting. Usually, I go after work and stay for between 20 and 30 minutes, between three and five days a week. If I wake up early enough, I can go for a short walk but, right now, the weather is just too hot to be outdoors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mostly, I\u2019m trying to work on my upper body strength, though I do work some on my leg strength. I start off with chin-ups, which I\u2019m able to get three or four. I usually finish with some time on a treadmill.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I realized right away is that it\u2019s going to take time. Like anything that\u2019s worth while, it takes commitment to keep working at it. It\u2019s not one of those things that I can do a few times and see real results. Nor is it something that I can say, \u201cwell nothing has changes, so I\u2019m just going to quit.\u201d Real change takes time \u2014 apparently it takes a lot of time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Real health takes time. But it\u2019s a daily thing. It takes more than half an hour at a gym, four days a week. Tomorrow\u2019s health is based on all of the seemingly small decisions that I\u2019ve made over the past few years. It\u2019s the walks and the diet and the emotional health, along with other things that help determine my health tomorrow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think?
