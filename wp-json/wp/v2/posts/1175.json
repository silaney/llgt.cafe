It can be really hard to meet new people. It can seem, at times, nearly impossible, especially when it seems that everyone is so busy, even if they are just checking their social media account(s). But there is hope.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can, put yourself in a social setting. Attend a conference, take a bus somewhere, go shopping or go for a walk in a place where you feel safe \u2014 like a mall.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may take time, but find someone who looks familiar. Try to start a conversation. If it turns into a friendship, great, if not, maybe it will, later. Whether you are an introvert or not, friendships take time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Introduce yourself and try to remember the other person\u2019s name. Try to make the other person feel comfortable. Remember that the other person may or may not remember your name the next time \u2014 or even at the end of the conversation. Remind them of your name, or ask them to remind you of their name.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Humor works. I went up to someone in a store and said that I would dance with them to the music, but I wouldn\u2019t want to embrace them. Even if you don\u2019t immediately have a new friend with whom you can share your deepest secrets, at least you can share your smile with someone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, look for others who may share your interest. I attended a church where the men were more interested in talking about tractors than other subjects: not interested. Don\u2019t look for people interested in talking about stamp collecting at a supermarket. Instead, join a stamp collecting club.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it can be hard to meet new people, but it\u2019s not impossible. Try this: cover your mouth and say \u201cimpossible\u201d. Now, take your hand and wad up the word before throwing up the word. There, you\u2019ve just taken the word out of your vocabulary. Better yet, give it to God, for nothing is impossible for God.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As an introvert, I understand what it\u2019s like to try to make new friends.
