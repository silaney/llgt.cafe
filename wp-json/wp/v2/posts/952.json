You may not be able to remove that pizza parlor from your neighborhood, or find a way to avoid passing by the donut shop on the way to work, but there are some things that you can do at home to make loosing weight easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, get rid of the high calorie snack foods, like cookies, sodas and even chips. I don\u2019t mean that you should go on a binge. If you can\u2019t give them away, maybe it would be a good idea to throw them out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, you look for ready to eat foods that you can eat. You may find vegetable trays in your deli or produce department, or prepared fruit salads. Try to avoid the pre-made dressings. Things like plain yogurt might be a good option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plan ahead. If you have something in the fridge or on the countertop ready to go, you are less likely to look for less healthy options. Also, if you take something when you travel, you are less likely to stop for fast food.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, try loading your refrigerator with healthier snacks. It may take some work to slice up some carrots, cut up some apples, or cook some brown rice. You can also search the internet for more ideas. You just may find that the extra effort is well worth it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you want to loose weight, changing your environment might help.
