No, I\u2019m not thinking of another Hollywood production but of a day in the future where the creator of all things will judge his creation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bible tells us that \u201cFor all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God\u201d. \u2014 Romans 3:23 (KJV) Romans 6:23 (KJV) tells us ,\u201dFor the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can either believe what God tells us through His Word, or we can reject what He has told us. If we put our faith in Jesus and in his finished work on the cross to pay the price for our sins, we are promised eternal life. If we reject Jesus and his free gift, we are promised a life eternally separated from the living God, away from His love, light and life in a place that the Bible calls Hell.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who, by faith, accept God\u2019s gift of eternal life, there is no judgment for sin. But our works will, one day, be judged. Have I shared God\u2019s love or withheld it? Have I used my light to point the way to God, or have I shined that light on myself? Have I used my life to build God\u2019s kingdom, or have I built my own kingdom here on Earth? Only God can judge the intentions of the heart.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bible is full of stories, times when God judged his creation. From the story of the great flood to the things to come shown in the book of Revelation, there have been times when God says \u201cEnough.\u201d There are times when God separates His own for the destruction of evil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>John 3:16 (KJV) tells us that, \u201cGod so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life.\u201d But it\u2019s up to each of us to decide whether we will put our faith in God\u2019s Son or we will try to make it to Heaven on our own. And, if we\u2019ve put our faith in the work of Jesus on the cross, what are we going to do with the life that we\u2019ve been given?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSee, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil.\u201d \u2014 Deuteronomy 30:15 (KJV)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The choice is ours. Decide before it\u2019s too late.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There is a judgement day coming.
