Bunnies were out. Squirrels came out later. There was a grey crown night heron near the hospital: just visiting, probably.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took me about half an hour to make it to the store. When I was close, I heard some homeless guy saying something that doesn\u2019t need to be repeated. Ever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I decided to take my own advice and picked up a planner, mainly for the purpose of menu planning. It goes from April 2024 though the end of 2025. The other day, I was cleaning up and threw away a 2023 planner that went unused, so I hope that this one actually gets used for what it is intended for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got more Play-Doh, because I like it. It\u2019s so much fun to squish and make things with. Unlike Lego, it just has one piece. It seems to just come in four colors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday, I joined a local gym. I need to decide when I should go and actually exercise instead of just asking about the membership. This morning, I walked about a mile and a half, then I took the bus back. That counts for something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I bought another song for my collection: Josh Baldwin\u2019s \u201cMade For More.\u201d I heard it on the radio and decided to buy it. It seems that I got the live version. I like it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s supposed to rain tomorrow. Maybe the rain will bring cooler temperatures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now might be a good time to go to the library. Maybe not, I need to go somewhere, in the opposite direction in about half an hour. I thought I was arriving on time last week and it turned out that I was a week early. Who knew. I didn\u2019t.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dear Diary, Morning came too early.
