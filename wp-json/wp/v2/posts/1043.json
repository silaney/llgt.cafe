I\u2019ve heard that Heaven is paradise. But that can mean different things to different people. No, there likely aren\u2019t streams of ice cream that we can eat from continually, thought that would be nice. You see, the focus in Heaven isn\u2019t us but on Jesus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, when we get to Heaven, there will be no more worries. We won\u2019t be wondering when the rapture is. We won\u2019t be worried about any of the things that bother us in this life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be no more sin: ours, that we can often be quite aware of, or those of others, which can so impact us in this life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be no more death or sorrow. There will be no sickness or disease. There will be no loneliness or longing. Instead, there will be prefect peace and perfect love.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be perfect beauty, whatever that may look like. And the Bible tells us that we will know as we are known. You see, God knows us and yet He still loves us. Perhaps, this is because He sees us not as we are but as we will be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One day, perhaps soon, God will take us home, caught up to be with Him. I don\u2019t know exactly what Heaven will be like, but I know my Savior. And I\u2019m looking forward to being with Him. By the way, no photo can do it justice.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are at least a few books that talk about Heaven and what it is like.
