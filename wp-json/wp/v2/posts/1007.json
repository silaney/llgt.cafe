Each of us needs to take the day off now and then \u2014 to rejuvenate and refresh our minds and bodies. If we don\u2019t \u2014 if we go to long without taking time off \u2014 we can burn out and our bodies or minds may force us to take time off because of sickness or depression.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, you may say, \u201cI can\u2019t take time off. There\u2019s just too much to do.\u201d But maybe you can take ten minutes here or there to relax, be thankful, or just enjoy life. Maybe you can take the time to take deep breaths \u2014 ten seconds breathing in, holding your breath and breathing out slowly. This can do so much to relieve stress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put on some relaxing music, go for a walk or draw. All of these things can help with stress and help refresh the mind. You don\u2019t have to take the whole day for one activity. Just spending a little time can help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can, find someone else to do some of the things that need to be done, even if you have to pay them, assuming you have the money and someone that you can trust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time off is just as important as the time we spent working and it cannot be ignored or put off indefinitely. It we try, it will eventually catch up with us.
