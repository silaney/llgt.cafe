We probably know a lot of things. But how many of them will affect where we spend eternity?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that God is good. Psalm 100:5 (KJV) tells us, \u201cFor the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.\u201d And we know that God is love: 1 John 4:7-10.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you think of yourself as A Christian? If so, how do we know that you have eternal life? It certainly isn\u2019t through good works that we are saved. If it were, I know that I wouldn\u2019t make it into heaven.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>God\u2019s standards are not our own, and he does not measure us by worldly standards. Romans 6:23 (KJV) says that, \u201cFor all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.\u201d And, \u201cAs it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one.\u201d<br>\u2014 Romans 3:10 (KJV)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFor I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures.\u201d \u2014 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 (KJV)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFor he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.\u201d \u2014 2 Corinthians 5:21 (KJV)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>John 3:16 (KJV) \u2014\u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Romans 10:9-10 (KJV) \u2014 \u201cThat if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFor whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\u201d \u2014 Romans 10:13 (KJV)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eternity is a long time. And, if we understand the times that we are in, it would be easy to believe that we are nearing a time that God is going to judge the earth and its inhabitants. Personally, I believe that Christ will come and take his church home before then. I can hardly wait.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For Saturday, June 3, 2023: What do we know?
