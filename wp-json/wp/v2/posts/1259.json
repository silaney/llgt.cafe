Today\u2019s teaching was the last in a series on the Sermon on the Mount, from Matthew 7. The thing that sticks out most in my mind is that the narrow road may be hard, but it is the only way to eternal life, for it leads to the only source of eternal life, which is Jesus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d \u2014 John 14:6 (KJV)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It rained while I was helping with parking. And it was windy, so I think we all got at least a little wet. I got wet because it wasn\u2019t raining when I went into church and had to go to my car to grab my umbrella before going to help with parking<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I heated up some chicken as part of my lunch, adding the last of my Chinese BBQ sauce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The church has Growth Track later today and I signed up to go. I was hoping to audition for singing, but I think I\u2019ll spare them having to hear me sing. Anyway, I\u2019m fine with parking duty.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>God,<br>Thank You for loving me. Thank You for sending Jesus to live and to die that I might have eternal life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Help all of those who are homeless and hungry. But even more than food and shelter, they need to know You.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Jesus\u2019 name,<br>Amen<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dear Diary,I woke up early enough to go for a walk before church.
