Unable to afford cable, Jack preferred to watch shows that he had managed to record on an old VCR, watching them on his old 19\u201d Sony television.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one hand, Jack held a beer. Most of the time that Jack was at home and felt alone, he had a beer in one hand. In his other hand, Jack held a Nokia. A revolver sat on Jack\u2019s lap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNine-one-one\u201d, said the voice on the other end of the phone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHi,\u201d said Jack, \u201cI\u2019m drunk.\u201d There was a pause. \u201cI mean I\u2019m Jack.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHow can I help you Jack,\u201d asked the female voice, a woman who spoke with a thick New Orleans accent?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI have a gun,\u201d said Jack, \u201cand I\u2019m not sure how to use it. I want to shoot myself, but\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDo you want me to send someone Jack,\u201d asked the woman?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Jack. \u201cI\u2019ll call my dad. Maybe he\u2019ll know how to use a gun.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAre you sure,\u201d asked the 911 operator?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d said Jack. \u201cHave a good night.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack hung up the phone. He set the phone down and picked up the revolver. His wife would be home soon. Jack looked at the gun and then put it on the table between the remote and his phone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least Jack could look forward to talking to his wife, Sandy, who actually had a job. Sandy was a resident nurse at the Tulane Medical Center. But even a nurse couldn\u2019t help Jack with what ailed him. And though the conversation would likely turn into an argument \u2014 over Jack\u2019s lack of ambition, finances, Jack\u2019s obsession with the TV, or the pile of dirty dishes in the kitchen sink \u2014 at least it was a conversation. Jack just hoped that Sandy never found anyone else who treated her better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>August 24, 2005 : Just Watching<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was no argument the night before. Jack had simply fallen asleep before Sandy made it home. He didn\u2019t hear her come in, turn off the television or sigh before going to bed. And Jack wasn\u2019t wasn\u2019t aware of the fact that Sandy had covered him with her favorite blanket before going to bed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Jack became aware enough, he got up and looked at the clock. It was just after four in the morning and so, after getting another beer out of the fridge, Jack put in the video and turned, sitting back down, turned on the television with the remote.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The video began playing right away. The video was of the last vacation that Sandy, Jack and Sarah had taken together. It was an overnight trip to Biloxi, Mississippi \u2014 and it had been Jack\u2019s and Sandy\u2019s annual vacation since they had gotten together nine years before. Together, Jack and Sandy were living their dream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then came the nightmare. It was a Saturday, and Sandy was at work, leaving Jack and Sarah at home. Sarah got bored watching the New Orleans Saints, so Jack gave Sarah, their eight year old daughter, permission to cross the street to see her best friend. However, when a red Mustang jumped the curb, Sarah was no more. The driver fled the scene. Police said that she never knew what hit her, but Jack and Sarah each felt the pain as if a dump truck had hit them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sandy drown her pain in work. If she could just keep working, she wouldn\u2019t feel the pain so much. Right? Jack began drinking, choosing, rather, to drown his pain in the beer after which he had been named and whose processing plant was just a few miles away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack was unaware that Sandy had woken up. She spotted the beer and, in a moment, the two were arguing. Things got so heated that Sandy left without having even a cup of coffee. Instead, she left for work and had a quick breakfast at one of the restaurants near the hospital.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After Sandy left, Jack turned off the television. He found a notebook and a pen in the kitchen and, after making a cup of coffee \u2014 black \u2014 Jack wrote this note.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dear Sandy,<br>I just need to get away for a while. I\u2019m going to see dad near Picayune. I\u2019ll be gone at least a week. Perhaps, after a little time away, we\u2019ll be able to work things out.<br>Jack<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack signed the letter without the word \u201cLove\u201d. Jack still loved Sandy very much. He just couldn\u2019t express how he felt and he felt that, if he had done things differently, Sarah would still be around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took jack about half an hour to pack a medium sized suitcase, along with a few beers and put it in his 1992 Dodge truck. It took Jack just over an hour to get to his dad\u2019s house near Hide-A-Way Lake. It was a nice little community and Jack\u2019s dad had retired from construction, though he had continued to work, building homes for missionaries returning home. The nice home and the nice car, however, were just reminders to Jack of how poorly he was doing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack\u2019s dad was going yard work in the front yard when Jack pulled into the driveway.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHi, dad,\u201d said Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGood to see you, Jack,\u201d said Michael. \u201cWhat brings you here this time,\u201d Michael continued, \u201cand where is..\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack interrupted, \u201cI just needed to get away for a while \u2014 maybe a week or more. I just need time to think \u2014 and maybe talk a little.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOkay, Jack,\u201d said his dad, \u201cyou know you\u2019re always welcome. You can sleep on the couch.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mom had died of cancer three years earlier, so it was just dad in the single bedroom home and, though the outside looked well kept, there were dirty dishes piled up in his kitchen sink, too. Jack found a rake leaned up against the house and began helping his dad with the yard work. Then the two went inside and, taking their place on the couch and in a recliner, the two began talking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDo you remember when mom put the electric kettle on the hot stove,\u201d asked Jack?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI sure do,\u201d said his dad. \u201cIt stunk up the kitchen for days.\u201d There was a pause. \u201cI sure do miss your mom.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d said Jack, \u201cme too.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack\u2019s dad turned on the television and flipped though what seemed like a hundred channels. There wasn\u2019t much on, but they did find news of a storm somewhere out there that might turn into a hurricane.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>August 25, 2005: A Chosen Path<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hurricane Katrina took paid a visit to the south tip of Florida before becoming a tropical storm and heading southwest into the gulf. But Jack had no idea what lay ahead as he and his dad began an eight hole round of golf. Jack had always hated golf, but it seemed to be the only way that he could spend any time with his dad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat do you do when you miss mom,\u201d Jack asked his dad, after what seemed like an eternity of silence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI pray,\u201d said Michel. \u201cShe\u2019s in God\u2019s care, now. And though I miss her dearly, I wouldn\u2019t want to take her away from her real home, not to the pain that she felt while she was here. Especially when\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael didn\u2019t have to finish the sentence. Jack knew what he was talking about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to come to church with me, tomorrow, if you like,\u201d Jack. \u201cThey\u2019d love to see ya there.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d said Jack, softly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that,\u201d asked his dad. \u201cI\u2019m a little hard of hearing these days.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d said Jack, louder this time. \u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d implying that he probably wouldn\u2019t enjoy it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two had lunch at the club before heading home \u2014 to Jack\u2019s dad\u2019s home, where Jack drank beer as he watched television. His dad passed time by building small end tables in the garage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThose are beautiful,\u201d Jack had told his dad at one point. But Jack was asleep when his dad finally came in from the garage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>August 26, 2005: In the Middle of Nowhere<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was still dark-fifteen when Jack woke up and looked at the digital clock by his \u201cbed.\u201d It took about five minutes for Jack to find his dad\u2019s keys and unlock his gun cabinet before throwing a shotgun into his trunk before taking off to go duck hunting. It was nearly an hours drive to a secluded piece of land where Jack could just get away and try to get something for dinner \u2014 for a weeks worth of dinners \u2014 for him and his dad. But Jack wound up with nothing, except for more than a few chiggers,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack finally packed up when his sunburn became noticeable. Then he drove back to his dad\u2019s house. It had just turned past 3 PM according to WWL radio and King Edward when Jack rolled into his dad\u2019s driveway, again. Jack\u2019s dad was watering the flowers in the front yard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSorry I missed church\u201d came at the same time as \u201cSorry you missed church.\u201d There was a pause and then Jack\u2019s dad added, \u201cYou can go with me tonight, if you like.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSure, dad,\u201d said Jack. \u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it for the world.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Michael. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave at 17:30 sharp \u2014or 5:30, if you prefer.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSure, dad,\u201d replied Jack, \u201c5:30 sharp.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack wasn\u2019t used to being a passenger. He was used to driving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHow is Sandy doing,\u201d asked Jack\u2019s dad?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t talk much these days,\u201d said Jack. \u201cI know she hurts,\u201d Jack added. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTell her you love her,\u201d said Michael. \u201cYou do love her don\u2019t you?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou know I do,\u201d answered Jack. \u201cI just feel so\u2026.\u201d Jack paused. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTry,\u201d said Jack\u2019s dad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt hurts,\u201d said Jack. \u201cIt hurts so bad I can hardly stand it.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTell her,\u201d said Michael. \u201cAnd tell her that you love her. She\u2019s hurting, too. After all, Sarah was her baby, too.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOkay, dad,\u201d said Jack, as the two turned the last corner to the church and pulled into the church parking lot.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHi brother,\u201d said Daniel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHi brother,\u201d said Michael.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHi Jack,\u201d said Daniel. \u201cWelcome.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThanks,\u201d said Jack, not sure what to think. Jack hadn\u2019t been to church since he was eight, but nothing had changed. It was still the same small brick and mortar building that seated less than a hundred. But it had a homy feeling that Jack could\u2019t shake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were only a hand full of people in attendance at the evening service and, after a few minutes of condolences and \u201cgood to see ya\u2019s,\u201d Jack and his dad took their seats third row from the back. Jack took an end seat, in case he needed to leave or use the bathroom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTurn in your Bibles to Psalm 22,\u201d said Pastor Edmonds, after precisely three hymns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the next hour, Jack listen intently as the pastor walked the small group thought Jesus\u2019 crucifixion. He spoke of the pain that Jesus felt as he was beaten and hung on the cross to pay our sin debt. He shard the pain that Jesus felt when his Heavenly Father turned away \u2014 forced to look away from our sins that \u201cJesus bore for us.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pastor finished with these words from the book of John: \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack was so overcome by emotion that he didn\u2019t wait to hear pastor call for an alter call before going up front. Michael followed and, after a few minutes conversation, Michale listened to Jack as he began to pray, \u201cGod, I need you. Help me\u2026.\u201d Jack finished his prayer with a hearty \u201cAmen.\u201d And he and his dad both had to wipe the tears away. Half and hour of conversation and several hugs later, Jack and his dad were on their way home, listening to a Michael Card tape that Jack\u2019s dad had picked up at a pawn shop for $1. There was dinner, no beer, a movie on dad\u2019s TV, and the best night of sleep that Jack had had in years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>August 27, 2005: Just Watching<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack and his dad had breakfast in town before going to the hardware store to pick up some things. This, too, Jack hated, but he loved the time with his dad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNow that you\u2019re born again,\u201d said Jack\u2019s dad, \u201cwe need to get you dunked.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBaptized, you mean,\u201d asked Jack?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYea,\u201d said Michael. \u201cWe need to get you wet.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d said Jack. \u201cHow about next Sunday?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d said Michael.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took two minutes for Jack and his dad to find the screws that Jack\u2019s dad was looking for and what seemed like forever for him to pick out the just the right ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t rush these things,\u201d said Jack\u2019s dad, before finally picking out a pack of 2.5 inch Philips had screws and moving on to the next item on the list: a new hammer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack listened at least somewhat patiently as his dad and the store owner, aka, brother Daniel, talked for a good forty five minutes or more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d insisted Jack\u2019s dad, \u201cit was only half an hour.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael drove to Churches and the two ordered lunch before heading to the park: Michale with his white meat and Jack with his dark. Each had mashed potatoes, a biscuit and an extra large soda. Jack continued watching a mother and her little girl play in the park as his dad made a trip to \u201ctake care of some personal business.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt still hurts,\u201d said Jack, as he watched the woman push her daughter on the swing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe pain will never go away completely,\u201d said Michel, \u201cbut over time, you\u2019ll learn to outsmart it.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a little embarrassing but Jack and his dad made it all the way though the move \u201cWar of the Worlds.\u201d It was a better option than the only other movie showing, \u201cThe Descent.\u201d It was an early movie and the two finished the evening at Sonics before heading back to Jack\u2019s dad\u2019s place. Jack\u2019s dad offered him a beer that he found in the garage, but Jack opted for a Cherry Sprite, instead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGood choice,\u201d said Michael.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThanks, dad,\u201d said Jack, \u201cfor everything.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d said Michel. \u201cYou know that I love you, right son?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYes, dad,\u201d said Jack, \u201cI do now.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGood night, Jack,\u201d said Michael, finally. \u201cHave a good night. See you in the morning.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGood night, dad,\u201d replied Jack. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d But apparently Jack\u2019s dad was in a hurry to get to the bathroom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>August 28, 2005: Where now?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack woke up but lay in bed. It was still dark out. There wasn\u2019t enough light to read the wall clock, something was blocking the digital clock next to the television and Jack didn\u2019t feel like looking at his phone to find out what time it was.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deep inside, Jack felt that something had changed. He was different. Yet, he wasn\u2019t sure what it was.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou got the Holy Spirit in you,\u201d said Micael, at the breakfast table. \u201cAnd you\u2019re alive in Christ.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s different,\u201d asked Jack?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYep,\u201d said Michael. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s different,\u201d he continued, with a great brig grin. \u201cWe need to get you a Bible and find you a church where you can get married \u2014 I mean, go to.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI think I\u2019m going to go hunting, again,\u201d said Jack, \u201cand leave for home tomorrow.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cKatrina might be headed that way,\u201d said Michael. \u201cYou never know with these things. I\u2019m going to the store to pick up a few supplies. Is there anything you\u2019d like?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCan I borrow your Bible,\u201d asked Jack?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSure, son. You know where to find it,\u201d said Michael. \u201cI\u2019ll get one for you in town,\u201d Michale added as he put on his raincoat and headed out the door.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack found his dad\u2019s Bible in its usual spot, on the night stand by his dad\u2019s bed. Michael always liked to start his day right: in God\u2019s Word. Jack wasn\u2019t sure where to start, but he remembered his dad saying something about the book of John. So, after looking in the front of the Bible, Jack turned to John chapter 1 and began reading.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.\u201d<br>It seemed that there was so much to learn about his new found faith, yet, deep within, Jack knew where he needed to begin. Indeed, Jack was\u2019t sure who he had become, but he was fairly certain that he knew who he wasn\u2019t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>August 29, 2005: Reality Check<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack sat up on the couch \u2014 awoken from a deep sleep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHi, dad,\u201d said Jack, still half asleep.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMorning, son,\u201d said Michael, sipping from his mug. \u201cI\u2019ve not made breakfast yet but there\u2019s a fresh pot of coffee in the kitchen if you want some.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack staggered into the kitchen, found a mug sitting on the counter and poured a steaming cup before returning to his spot on the couch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI had a strange dream,\u201d Jack told his dad after taking his first sip of coffee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYea,\u201d inquired Michael.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI dreamed that there was an alien invasion. I needed to stay inside to keep from dying, but I needed to rescue Sandy.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSounds exciting,\u201d said Michel. \u201cMy dreams are usually so boring they put me to sleep.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFunny, dad,\u201d said Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHave you heard from Sandy,\u201d asked Michael? \u201cThey\u2019re evacuating much of lower Louisiana because of Katrina.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWho\u2019s Katrina,\u201d asked Jack, \u201cand what did she do?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHurricane Katrina,\u201d said Michael.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Jack. \u201cI guess I\u2019ve been kind out out of it for the past few days.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cKind of,\u201d asked Jack\u2019s dad? \u201cPhone is on the wall in the kitchen if you want to use it.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThanks dad,\u201d said Jack, slowly standing up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack walked back into the kitchen and, dialed his home phone. \u201cSandy must be at work already,\u201d said Jack, calling back to his dad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI guess she\u2019s needed at the hospital,\u201d said Michael, as Jack returned to the living room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI never noticed that family photo \u2014 Sandy, Sarah and me \u2014 on the wall in the hallway before,\u201d said Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou gave it to us,\u201d said Michael, \u201cJust before your mom died.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Jack, turning his attention back to the news.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNew Orleans,\u201d said Michel, \u201cShe\u2019s an old lady \u2014 and she\u2019s falling apart.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHuh,\u201d said Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cKatrina is taking her toll on the crescent city.\u201d Michael continued, \u201cLevees aren\u2019t holding the water back and there\u2019s going to be flooding.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7:45 AM, Some times you hear the splash<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sandy managed to take a quick peek outside one of the hospital\u2019s windows, though she was busy and tried to avoid being near any window with all of the debris flying around from the incredible winds that engulfed the hospital.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sandy had been along Lake Pontchartrain many tines, even when the wind was strong, causing white caps on lake waves, but nothing like this. You could hear the splash of the waves against the levees but mostly, there was the sound of the wind as it rushed by one\u2019s ears.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHow is Jack doing,\u201d asked another nurse, Charity?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone to spend time with his dad,\u201d said Sandy. \u201cI worry about him. He\u2019s not handled Sarah\u2019s death well and I\u2019m sure he blames himself.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t his fault,\u201d said Charity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou know that and I know that,\u201d said Sandy, \u201cbut there\u2019s no convincing Jack. Now, he just spends his time drinking, and it\u2019s getting to me.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cJust hang in there, Sandy,\u201d said Charity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a silence in the room for a moment until the loud speaker broke in: \u201cCode blue, C12, code blue, C12.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9:01 AM: The truth sinks in<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s been said that all of the water from Lake Pontchartrain couldn\u2019t wash New Orleans and, especially the French Quarter, clean,\u201d said Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d said Micheal, \u201cit just sent the dirt other places \u2014 like Houston.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack and Michel watched the television, uncertain of what to think, as the Chief of Police for Orleans County, drenched in tears, spoke of the damage from Katrina on WWL News. The full extent of the damage would not be known for some time, but it was clear that so many had lost homes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack returned to the kitchen. This time he tried calling Sandy\u2019s cell phone. But power had gone out and there was no cell service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI need to find Sandy,\u201d said Jack, as he faced his dad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9:33 AM: Off to see Jim<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack had a friend several miles down a long dirt road. He had flown helicopters in Korea. Maybe he could help Jack get back to New Orleans. The only problem was that Jack hadn\u2019t been invited and Jack didn\u2019t know Jim\u2019s phone number. He did know that Jim owned his own helicopter and that he couldn\u2019t stand the thought of just sitting around doing nothing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack set his luggage back in the trunk of his car and, after hugging his dad, climbed back into the driver\u2019s seat and headed down the road to see Jim.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was some drive to Jim\u2019s house. One fill up and two pit stops later, down highways and dirt roads, Jack finally reached the edge of Jack\u2019s property.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack read these words at the entrance to Jim\u2019s property. \u201cIf I don\u2019t know you, you ain\u2019t welcome. I will kill you with kindness,\u201d which was the name that Jim gave his rifle. Maybe he named his bullets love, but Jack wasn\u2019t concerned about that, now. Jack opened the gate and drove up to Jim\u2019s house. Jim stood at the door with kindness, but set it down when he recognized Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGood to see you, Jack,\u201d said Jim. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cToo long,\u201d said Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCome on in,\u201d said Jim. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI am, a bit,\u201d admitted Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cClair made lunch,\u201d said Jim. \u201cAnd you know her, she has trouble cooking for just the two of us.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHi Jack,\u201d said Clair, as she greeted Jack at the door with a hug and a kiss on the cheek. Now, this wasn\u2019t just a house, it was a home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI need a ride to New Orleans,\u201d said Jack. \u201cRoads are out so it\u2019ll have to be by helicopter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOkay,\u201d said Jim, \u201cbut we\u2019ll have to wait till winds die down \u2014 for our own safety.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBreakfast is getting cold,\u201d said Clair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d said Jack. \u201cAs long as the hearts are warm.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5:30 PM: A beautiful dinner<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clair pulled a whole chicken out of the oven and set it on the kitchen\u2019s island before putting freshly chopped parsley on the steaming bowl of mashed potatoes. It was enough to feed a small platoon, but Clair loved to cook, especially for Jim. Jack watched with amazement as Clair worked, neatly stacking her dishes by the kitchen\u2019s double sink.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI love my kitchen,\u201d said Clair. \u201cI could spend the whole day in here,\u201d she continued, \u201cif it weren\u2019t for Jim\u2019s health getting worse lately.\u201d There was an awkward pause and then \u201cServe yourself. You can find your plate on the table.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Famished, Jack grabbed his plate and, wanting to be polite, chose moderation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTake all you want,\u201d said Clair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Jack took a little more and went to his seat. He did wait till Jim and Clair joined him before he began to eat. Jim was next to be seated at the gorgeous dining room table that had the most beautiful multi colored roses as a center piece. All bowed their heads and Jim prayed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFather, thank you for this wonderful food that my beautiful wife prepared. Thank you for bringing Jack here safely. Bless the remainder of the evening and our travels tomorrow. Amen.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack wasn\u2019t sure where to start first, so he began with the cornbread. It was amazing and had pieces of corn in it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clair started the conversation. \u201cJim tells me that you were both in the Army.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Jack, after swallowing. I was a cook on the flight line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDid you two meet in the military?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNo, actually,\u201d replied Jack. \u201cI took a job at the VA as a cook and so we met there.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDo you have any favorite recipes,\u201d asked Clair?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d answered Jack. \u201cI don\u2019t cook much these days. \u201cOne day, I hope to go to cooking school and open a restaurant. It\u2019s just a dream right now.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to have a dream,\u201d said Jim. \u201cThe Bible says that people perish without a vision.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation was going slowly, and Jim quickly finished his first plate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to seconds, Jim,\u201d said Clair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d said Jack, \u201cI think I will have seconds. It\u2019s all so delicious.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s desert in the fridge, too, if you have room left,\u201d said Clair, but Jack was already gone by the time Clair finished talking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Claire got up and went into the kitchen as Jack finished his second plate of food. She returned for a moment, carrying a small plate with freshly baked peach pie smothered in vanilla ice cream.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to eat it,\u201d said Clair, handing a similar plate to Jim.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Jack, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of passing up on this. Thank you so much. It looks delicious.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d said Clair, before disappearing back into the kitchen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSo, Jack,\u201d asked Jim, \u201cwhat\u2019s your plan?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cRoads are gone,\u201d said Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve flown into both New Orleans\u2019 airports,\u201d said Jack, but I don\u2019t know what shape they\u2019ll be in.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cRight,\u201d continued Jack. \u201cSandy\u2019s likely at the hospital. She\u2019s probably safe, but I don\u2019t want to get home to find out that I was wrong.\u201d Jack paused and then continued, \u201cThe best option is for you to take me into the French Quarter and drop me off near the hospital. There\u2019s a Greyhound but station across the street. Maybe you can drop me off on the roof. I doubt the hospital will let you land on their roof.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThey might,\u201d replied Jim, \u201cbut I have a good friend near City Park that has a boat. He can pick you up from, say, one of the bridges in town and take you to the hospital in no time.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d said Jack. \u201cWhat time do you want to leave?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI would say 06:00 hours,\u201d said Jim, \u201cbut, sorry Jack, I wouldn\u2019t miss Clair\u2019s breakfast for the world. We can leave at 8 AM.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Jack, \u201cI look forward to breakfast, too.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack got up to walk into the kitchen. \u201cHave a good night Jim. Your room is down the hall and to the left. I\u2019d love to talk more, but this is Clair\u2019s and my cuddle time.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThanks Jim,\u201d said Jack, but Jim was already gone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>August 30, 2005: They say you can never go back to what you left<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After breakfast, Jim preformed a quick pre-flight check while Jim took a much needed shower and changed clothes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI phoned Al,\u201d Jim told Jack. \u201cHe has one of those fancy satellite phones. He\u2019ll meet you near the Twin Span and take you to Tulane Medical Center.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a short flight to the Twin Span and Jack could see Al waiting in his boat as the two approached in Jim\u2019s helicopter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jim landed and Jack climbed out of the helicopter then climbed down one of the bridge\u2019s pillars and into Al\u2019s boat. A quick introduction and the two were off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you as close as I can to the front of the hospital,\u201d said Al, but the entrance is probably under water. You know how to swim,\u201d asked Al?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cA little,\u201d answered Jack. \u201cI used to swim in creaks and streams, growing up.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWell,\u201d said Al, \u201cLake Pontchartrain has come to us.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt was just after 11 AM as Al drove his boat up to the front of the hospital. And the two had seen what Katrina had done to the Super Dome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThey have a lot to rebuild,\u201d said Al.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d replied Jack, \u201ca lot.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs I see it,\u201d said Al, \u201cwe have a few options. We can try to get someone to open a window, or you can try to make your way though the front door.\u201d There was a pause. \u201cI don\u2019t know if those windows open.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll try swimming,\u201d said Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTake deep breaths before you go into the water. It\u2019s cold,\u201d said Al, after sticking a finger into the water. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s too much floating in the water, but be careful. If you can\u2019t get in right away, come back. I\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201d There was another pause. \u201cI\u2019ll give you half an hour before I head home. Remember, be careful.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Al handed Jack a flashlight. \u201cHere,\u201d said Al, \u201cyou\u2019re going to need this.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The flashlight turned out to be waterproof, but after a swim of nearly two minutes, Jack emerged to find that his watch wasn\u2019t nearly as waterproof. It had stopped working soon after Jack hit the cold water. \u201cNo evaluator,\u201d thought Jack to himself so, after finding the stairway, Jack went up to the second floor. He was soaking wet when he got there and out of breath.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDo you know where I can find Sarah Hammer,\u201d Jack asked a nurse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s on the fifth floor,\u201d answered the nurse. \u201cAre you a relative?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m her husband,\u201d said Jack, proudly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOkay, then,\u201d said the nurse. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to take the stairs.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d said Jack, softly, \u201cI know.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11:48 AM: Where\u2019s Sandy?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack\u2019s watch may not have worked, but the battery powered clock on the wall of the fifth floor did.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhere can I find Sandy Hammer,\u201d asked Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s not available right now,\u201d said the nurse. \u201cCan I give her a message?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cA message,\u201d asked Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYour name,\u201d asked the nurse?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cJack,\u201d was the reply. \u201cSandy is my wife.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said the nurse. \u201cI\u2019m Charity, \u201cSandy has told me so much about you. But\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBut what,\u201d asked Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSandy is in emergency surgery.\u201d Charity continued, \u201cshe won\u2019t be out for at least another hour.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was nearly an hour and a half before Sandy emerged from the operating room and was able to change out of surgery garb and into her normal nursing uniform. Charity had told her that Jack was waiting for her and, by the time that the two met, again, out in the hallway, Jack was mostly dry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGood to see you, Jack,\u201d said Sandy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI love you so much, Sandy,\u201d said Jack. Sliding down to the floor, Jack got on his knee and, with tears in his eyes, said, \u201cSandy, will you marry me?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d said Sandy, herself, holding back tears of joy. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBut what,\u201d asked Jack?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m needed in surgery in an hour, and\u2026\u201d continued Sandy. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should take a quick nap or get something to eat. I\u2019m starved.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t help you with the nap,\u201d replied Jack, \u201cbut I\u2019m hungry, too.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Brief History<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1803, the United States purchased no small stretch of land from French First Republic known as the Louisiana Purchase. It stretched from New Orleans in a narrow strip of land, widening as it went north, even covering a portion of Canada. East to west, it covered much of the Central time zone as well as part of the Mountain time zone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>New Orleans, LA, as with some other coastal areas, turned out to be sinking sand. It seems that some early structures in the area sank, as much as one story, until a way was discovered to build on that type of soil. The French had build levees in the New Orleans area as early as 1717. The city of New Orleans has been below sea level for some time now and must pump rain water out of the city.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, in 1984, Sandy Hammer graduated from nursing school at Tulane University\u2019s nursing school. Then, after graduation, she got a job at Tulane Medical Center. In early 1994, Sandy was raped by a man she thought was her friend. Sandy kept her baby and so Sarah Hammer was born.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was in 2001 that Jack and Sandy met and, after dating for a few months, Jack moved in with Sandy and her daughter. Jack had moved from Mississippi to New Orleans where he took odd jobs with the hopes of saving up enough money to one day to get his culinary degree and perhaps open his own restaurant. In 2003, Sarah was killed by a hit-and-run driver and, for Jack and Sandy, things just went down hill from there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day that Sarah died, she was going to see her friend, Sophia, who Sarah said, \u201cneeded Jesus.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d I asked Sarah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSophia need to know that God loves her.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOkay, sweetie,\u201d I said. \u201cBe careful.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI will,\u201d said Sarah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then she was gone. Now, I know that she\u2019s with Jesus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>August 31, 2005 and beyond: What now?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack woke up from a deep sleep and sat up. All he knew now was that Sandy had given him a blanket and a pillow and he had spent the night on one of the hospital\u2019s few couches. Jack knew that there was a lot of water but, just how much water there was, Jack wasn\u2019t sure. He didn\u2019t know, for example, that some estimated that as much as ninety percent of New Orleans was under water \u2014 as much as nine feet in some places.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was nearly a week \u2014 a week of hospital food and sleeping on the same couch \u2014 that Jack and Sarah were able to leave the hospital.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah took some time off from work and went to stay in Baton Rouge with family while Jack was able to head back to his dad\u2019s in Mississippi where he would stay until he and Sandy could have a \u201cproper marriage.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>September 24, 2023: The phone call<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack picked up the phone at his dad\u2019s house and dialed the phone number. In his right hand, Jack held the phone to his ear. With his left hand, Jack held his dad\u2019s credit card.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTimes-Picayne,\u201d said the woman on the other end of the line. \u201cHow may I direct your call?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI need to place an obituary in the paper,\u201d said Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack\u2019s call was answered by a man named Ken and, after a few minutes, Ken read Sarah\u2019s obituary back to Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSarah Hammer was born September 23, 1994 in New Orleans, LA. She died September 23, 2003 from injuries caused by a hit-and-run driver who was never identified. Sarah died way too young. Jack, Sarah\u2019s adopted dad, wants the driver to know that, whoever you are and wherever you may find yourself, he forgives you.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a moment of silence but Jack could tell that Ken was choking back tears, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThat will be $72,\u201d said Ken. \u201cHow would you like to pay?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDo you accept Monopoly money, asked Jack?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>October 1, 2005: The call that changes everything<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack had been with a friend at work when a family member had phoned to say that her 29 year old son in California had \u201cfinally succeeded in killing himself.\u201d And Jack had held his friend as the tears flowed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack had also heard of friends who got \u201cthe call\u201d from the doctor\u2019s office to let them know that the results were in and that they needed to come in as soon as possible for a followup visit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This time, it was Jack who was getting the phone call.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI know what you did,\u201d said the voice on the other end of the line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat,\u201d asked Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSorry,\u201d said the man. \u201cIt\u2019s Al. I heard what you did, and I\u2019m impressed.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a pause as Jack wondered what it was that he had done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYour dad told me more about you. He also told me about you and Sandy. He also told me about Sarah\u2019s obituary. I\u2019m impressed, Jack.\u201d<br>\u201cOh,\u201d said Jack, not sure what else to say. \u201cOkay.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working on some numbers,\u201d said Al. \u201cIn the fall, you can move into an apartment in Baton Rouge, where you will start classes at the Louisiana Culinary Institute. And, Jack,\u201d added Al, \u201cIt\u2019s all paid for.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack was stunned. \u201cI &#8211; I -I,\u201d was about all Jack could get out. \u201cBut how?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAfter graduation,\u201d continued Al, \u201cYou can come work for me at one of my restaurants and we can work on getting you your own restaurant. How does that sound, Jack,\u201d asked Al?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt sounds Amazing,\u201d said Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhen you finish school,\u201d said Al,\u201dwe can work on wedding plans.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>January 7, 2006: Off to school<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack packed the last of his things into the back of his car and, after giving his dad one last hug, drove just over one-hundred miles to his new apartment in Baton Rouge. Within a week, Jack had a job delivering pizza for a locally owned restaurant. It fit well with Jack\u2019s classes and allowed Jack to get to know the area better. Jack also took time to visit many of the local restaurants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack\u2019s time at the school passed quickly and, when it came time, Jack contacted Al, again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI have to do six months externship,\u201d Jack told Al, \u201cbefore I can graduate.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Al.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to work at the Copeland\u2019s in Slidell,\u201d said Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d said Al, \u201cI know the owner, personally,\u201d he said, laughing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYeah,\u201d said Jack, still disbelieving all that he had been blessed with over the past year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHave you thought about yours and Sandy\u2019s wedding,\u201d asked Al?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEvery day since I asked Sandy to marry me,\u201d said Jack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d said Al. \u201cSend me an email with the details when they day approaches. And Jack,\u201d added Al, \u201cdon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s covered.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The email<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack finished his externship at the end of May 2007 and sent Jack an email before driving from Slidell to Baton Rouge for his classes graduation. Before leaving, Jack sent the following email to Al.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi Al,<br>I want to thank your all that you\u2019ve done. Graduation is tomorrow, and I look forward to returning to Coplands where I\u2019m moved up to being assistant manager in training. I plan to marry Sandy at my dad\u2019s house just outside of Picayune. You\u2019re welcome to come but there\u2019s no need to have an expensive wedding. My dad\u2019s pastor is conducting the wedding. Sandy and I have both invited our families and a few friends. If you don\u2019t mind, I would like for you to be the best man.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, if you could drop by and pick up a little girl named Sophia in New Orleans. I\u2019ve contacted her mom and she has agreed to allow Sophia to be the flower girl. Unfortunately, he mom doesn\u2019t have a car, or a job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks, again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sincerely,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More bad news<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jack picked up his copy of the \u201cTimes-Picayune\u201d and, flipping though it\u2019s pages, saw these words: \u201cEleven Year Old Girl Killed in Accidental Gang Shooting.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Normally, Jack wouldn\u2019t pay much attention to such an article, but the name of the girl caught Jack\u2019s attention. It was Sophia, the girl that had been Sarah\u2019s friend, the one who lived across the street, that had been killed by a bullet meant for an individual at the home next door to Sophia\u2019s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In following days, Jack searched for and found Sophia\u2019s obituary and, when the day arrived, attended her funeral. Jack\u2019s hopes of having Sophia as a flower girl had been dashed and it hurt Jack deeply.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the funeral, Jack found Sophia\u2019s mother and, as the two embraced, both Jack and Louise wept. It was hard \u2014 so hard \u2014 for both of them. And neither one could figure out why such a thing had happened. Why would a loving God have allowed Sophia to have been killed a such a young age? Why would anyone die at such a young age. Unfortunately, this world offers us no answers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only positive was that Both Sophia and her mother had asked Jesus into their lives because of Sarah\u2019s love for Jesus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>June 3, 2006:Finally, wedding day arrives<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Jack and Sandy prepared for their wedding, Jack\u2019s dad took pictures of his son with his camera and Sandy\u2019s mom took pictures of her daughter with her camera. Jack was dressed first and used to opportunity to look outside at where the wedding ceremony would be held. At the back, near a table draped with with white linen, was an 8\u201dx10\u201d photograph \u2014 a memorial \u2014 to Sophia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11:17 AM<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re getting married at your dads home, there is no \u201clate\u201d. But Sandy was a little late, as it was the plan for Sandy to walk down the \u201cisle\u201d at 11 AM. She had to have heard the wedding music playing, but \u2014 never mind that. It was now 11:20 and the woman that Jack saw as the most beautiful the world was now standing before him.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pastor Edmonds gave a short 45 minute \u201ctalk\u201d about the importance of marriage, as found in the Bible, before reading Jack\u2019s and Sandy\u2019s vows, having each of them repeat their vows before some eighteen witnesses and guests. Al was Jack\u2019s best man. Sadly, it was the last time Jack would see Al, who died on March 23, 2008.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the vows, the two exchanged rings and then came the \u201cYou may now kiss the bride.\u201d This is an order that no couple refuses, and Jack\u2019s and Sandy\u2019s kiss lasted over a minute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next came the signing of the marriage license and the reception which, due to expected rain, was held indoors. There was wedding cake that Sandy\u2019s mom had made \u2014 it was beautiful, and champagne that Al had brought. No, there was no cake smearing, but there was more kissing and picture taking. Then there was music and dancing \u2014 outdoors, as the rain died down and finally stopped. No one really cared about a little rain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was little indication on Jack\u2019s car that he and Sandy had just wed and, around 6 PM, the two said their last goodbyes and made the one hour drive to their hotel in Biloxi, Mississippi for a five day honeymoon, courtesy of Al and the couple\u2019s families. That week, the weather was gorgeous, with the exception of afternoon showers. But Jack and Sandy were in love and even a little rain couldn\u2019t spoil their love for one another.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the honeymoon, Jack and Sandy Daniels moved into their new home \u2014 finally back in New Orleans, Louisiana. It wasn\u2019t huge, but it was beautiful and had the kitchen that Jack had always dreamed of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>March 11, 2007: A trip to the hospital<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 5 AM, Jack drove Sandy to the hospital. And at 7:23 AM, Lily Grace Daniels was born, weighing 6 pounds, 2 ounces and measuring 19 inches. There was something magical about the first time that Sandy and Jack lay eyes on their baby girl. And, in spite of first appearances, it was love at first sight.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There really are happy endings. The good may not last, but neither does the bad. And you can find a silver lining in just about any cloud, somewhere. You just have to know where to look.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You don\u2019t realize that it\u2019s really you doing these things until it\u2019s too late.
