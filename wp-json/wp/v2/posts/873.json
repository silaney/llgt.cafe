First created around 1900, the burger probably likely gained it\u2019s popularity at the 1904 World&#8217;s Fair in St. Louis, Missouri.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to chef Gordon Ramsay, if you are making your own burger patties, you will want to prepare your burgers well in advance, seasoning shaping your patties ahead of time. Chef Ramsay recommends that you use ground beef from different cuts of meat, along with egg, to help the burger hold shape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though traditional hamburgers are made up of a ground beef patty on a burger bun, you may wish to use a vegetable or bean burger patty, or even a portobello mushroom. And you may dress it with any or all of the following:ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish, lettuce, tomato, onion, bacon, pickles, or cheese. And because this is an international holiday, you may want to try a condiment from another country, such as pesto from Italy, salsa from Mexico, or wasabi from Japan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can pan-fry, grill, barbecue, broil or flame broil your burger, and you can toast or grill your buns, which helps prevent the bun from getting soggy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you prefer, you can also go out and get burgers from your favorite restaurant. If you don\u2019t know where to go, you can ask a friend or co-worker, check out reviews online or read any of a number of lists of best hammers in the Unite States. Or you can be brave and try some place you\u2019ve never been before.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>May 28 is International Hamburger Day.
