It\u2019s easy to do. There\u2019s always a list of things that need to be taken care of, plus all of the things that could go wrong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things that top my worry list are, however, usually things that are outside of my control. It would be great if I could say, \u201cWell, I have no control over that, so, I\u2019m just not going to worry about that.\u201d But that\u2019s not normally how it goes. Fortunately, I can look back and realize that things normally work out, one way or another, even if it\u2019s not exactly what I expected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?\u201d \u2014 Romans 8:31 (KJV)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s also Romans 8:28 (KJV) that tells us, \u201cAnd we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Worry steals our joy, and does little to nothing to actually solve any problems. One possible solution would be to draw a circle in the middle of a piece of paper. At the top of the page, write a short description of what the paper is. Inside the circle, write what you can and should do to resolve the issue. Outside the circle, write the things that could happen that are outside of your control. You might be amazed how putting things in writing can help reduce stress and worry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some times, I have to remind myself: stop, and take a deep breath. God is in control. So I pray, reminding myself to \u201cBe careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.\u201d \u2014 Philippians 4:6 (KJV)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a Christian doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t have any problems. What it does mean is that, when I do have problems, I have my loving Heavenly Father that I can take them to. And, if God chooses not to take my problems away, at least I know that he will walk through them with me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you ever worry? It\u2019s easy to do.
