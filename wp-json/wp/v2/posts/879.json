It\u2019s not something that you can buy, and it\u2019s not something that you can wrap up in a box. The best gift that you can give to anyone is your time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there is more to it than just being present. You should also be fully engaged with the other person. You shouldn\u2019t be updating your Instagram account, or playing video games (unless you are both playing), and you shouldn\u2019t be hiding behind a newspaper.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being present means actually listening to the other person, and even responding to that person when it is appropriate: not interrupting, but acknowledging that you are listening to what the other person is trying to say.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may mean scheduling time, or making adjustments to your life so that you have time to spend with friends or family. Free time may be scarce, and when it does come along, spending time with others may not be the first thing that comes to mind. Instead, we may find it easier to just spend that time alone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we should try to keep ourselves healthy. We may have limited control over how long we will live, but we can at least try to stay healthy. Exercise, proper diet, along with regular physical exams can go a long way in keeping us alive longer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that we still need to respect the time of others. Time is something that we often take for granted, but it truly is the best gift that you can give to anyone. Also, remember that time is the best gift that someone else can give to you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is the best gift that you can give your friends or family?
