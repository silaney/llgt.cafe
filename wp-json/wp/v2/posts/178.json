Back in his locker, as the story goes, they found a note that simply read, \u201cI\u2019m third.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a story that I\u2019ve taken with me and, though it is unlikely that that I will ever find myself in a failing aircraft, facing the choice of my life or the lives of others, there is something that can be learned from this story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it\u2019s something new or, more likely, it\u2019s just a cycle that we\u2019re going through. Slowly we begin to loose respect for life. It begins with those most in need: the elderly, the poor, those with special needs and the unborn. Not that I have anything against the American Bald Eagle, but when a person can serve more time for killing a Bald Eagle than for killing another human being, it seems that something just aint right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Respect is something that has to be taught. It needs to be modeled, it has to be demanded, or it won\u2019t be passed on from one generation to the next. Not only do we have to put on a show for all to see but, more and more this seems to be come a me, or an i generation. My feeling is that those who model disrespect for anyone, especially those who do so in a public forum, out to be ashamed. And, yes, it goes both ways. It goes well beyond stimulus checks and money for the airlines. It\u2019s all about the respect that we show or fail to show.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether we realize it or not, when we devalue others, we are also devaluing ourselves. You can\u2019t have one without the other. But we\u2019re often so busy demanding our own say, shifting the blame, and wondering when someone else is going to make things right, that we fail to see our own part in the downward trend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you were one of the lucky few who had a respect for others modeled for you. Great. Are you doing the best you can to model it for others? Believe it or not, showing others respect, even making yourself third, doesn\u2019t in anyway diminish who you are. In fact, it could turn you from an i back to an I.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exodus 20: 12 (KJV) says, \u201c Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.\u201d Want to know how to live a long life? Respect others, starting with your parents. It\u2019s pretty simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m not guaranteeing that anyone can change overnight. It\u2019s taken me years, and I\u2019m still working on building respect, not only for myself, but for others. Some times, it has to begin with forgiving others and, yes, forgetting any wrongs that may have been done to us. But even the longest journey has to begin somewhere<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many years ago, when I was still in high school, I heard a story about a pilot who, when faced with loosing his own life or allowing his plane to crash into a crowd of onlookers, chose to stay with his plane and give up&nbsp;<a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/the-value-of-respect\">&hellip;<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":179,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[29],"tags":[3],"class_list":["post-178","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-think-about-it","tag-llgt"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/178","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=178"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/178\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":180,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/178\/revisions\/180"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/179"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=178"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=178"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=178"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
