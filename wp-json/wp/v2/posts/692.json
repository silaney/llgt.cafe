It wasn\u2019t until I saw the snort video a second time that I realized that a truck had lost its front tire, which was almost immediately run over by a much smaller car, causing it to begin falling apart as it short into the air.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m sure that we\u2019ve all had bad days, and I\u2019m sure that the driver of the small car had a bad day, assuming he or she survived the incident. I know that I\u2019ve had my share of bad days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we celebrate what seems like the worst of bad days. A man had been falsely accused and, knowing that he is going to die, sweats drops of blood. Before his execution is beaten till he is nearly dead and then the exception beings. No, it\u2019s not a bullet that takes his life. It\u2019s not a lethal injection or a surge of electricity. It was a slow death by nails and a cross.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What we celebrate on Good Friday is the suffering of Jesus \u2014 as he offered his life, a sacrifice for our sins. Jesus had committed no crime. It was true, he had said that he was equal with God, but it isn\u2019t a lie to tell the truth. Jesus was both man and God. If he weren\u2019t, he could not offer his life to redeem us from our sins. But he was so he could. All I have to do is believe. In fact, there is nothing else I can do. I had a sin debt and, as the song goes, \u201cJesus paid it all.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever you celebrate this weekend, however you celebrate, please remember that it was on Good Friday that the Savior of the world hung on a cross and died \u2014 taking the punishment that we deserved \u2014 so that we might have eternal life. It was out of love for us that he willingly gave his life.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I saw a video where a car seemed to explode on a California freeway.
