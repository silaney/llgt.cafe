It feels good to be in love and to spend time with those we love. But love is also an action word: mainly, love gives and love serves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Love does not take by force, but it does receive. It is not controlling, but is always looking out for the best for and in others. Real love takes time, and is built on trust. We may be attracted to someone, but real love cannot be rushed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Love causes us to do things, sometime strange things, for those we love. This could range from buying flowers to making lifelong commitments, as in marriage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Love is not built on feelings, and it does not always feel good; pain and frustration can be very real parts of love.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Romans 5:8 (KJV) tells us that, \u201cBut God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m so glad the John 3:16 doesn&#8217;t say that God so loved the world that he strongly considered sending his son to die so that we might have life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without love, the world would be a very lonely place.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Love can be a powerful emotion.
