It doesn\u2019t pay well right now, but I expect to be mediocre some day. Maybe even slightly funny.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me: Do you have any witnesses to collaborate your story?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolf: I\u2019m not sure. I think everyone fell asleep after the first minute of my act. The bartender may have been able to stay awake.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me: So, Rolf, tell me about yourself. What do you like to do in your free time?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolf: Short walks on a long leash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me: Where do you like to spend most of your time?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolf: In bed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me: Other than that?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolf: At the dog park.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me: And what do you do there?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolf: I like to check out the girl dogs. You know, do the sniff test. Anyway\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me: Do you talk to these girl dogs<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolf: I try to and I\u2019m not shy. I just don\u2019t think they understand me or my sense of humor. I graduated from college, after all. You know, I paid a guy in a dark alley $1,200 for my diploma form Harvard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me: Did you actually take any classes?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolf: No, why?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me: What is your favorite food?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolf: Cat. No, seriously, I like just about everything \u2014 Italian, American, Indian, Hawaiian, Mexican\u2026. I\u2019ve studied British foods but I find most of them to be too bland. And cow tongue, I won\u2019t touch it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me: Favorite music.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolf: I love <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3k4mLWQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Audrey Assad<\/a>. At least her music. I don\u2019t think she would go for a dog like myself. I love it all \u2014 some more than others. It\u2019s like a drug to me. I\u2019m addicted. Seriously.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me: Drugs? Are drug a problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolf: Yes. My owner drug me to the opera last Saturday. I kept waiting for the fat lady to sing, but there were none.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me: What do you drink at the bar?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolf: Water, unless I they serve a good chai tea. Do you know how hard it is to find a real good chai tea?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me: No.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolf: I found one place near the University of Arkansas but they want almost $6 for a small cup. A good cup of cappuccino is nearly impossible to find and I\u2019m not going to Italy any time soon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me: Speaking of going anywhere, maybe you should plan to stay in town for the next week or two.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolf: I plan to. I have shows to preform this Saturday and the next. Besides, I just walked form Vegas where my Pa and Grandpa live and, boy, are my Pas tired.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me: Do you have any tickets?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolf: For you? No. It\u2019s first come first serve. Ten dollar minimum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me: Okay, Rolf, you\u2019re free to go \u2014 for now. You\u2019ve been very funny \u2014 I mean \u201cinformative\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rolf: Thank you, thank you very muuuch. No, wait. If you have extra dog food, make sure you share it with others who are in need. There are a lot of hungry dogs out there. And make sure you share the love. Don\u2019t keep it to yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me: Ladies and gentlemen \u2014 Rolf the Dawg.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I had a chance to talk to Rolf downtown at the Cook County Police Department and these are my findings.
