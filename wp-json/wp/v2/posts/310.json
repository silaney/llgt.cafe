I pray that you find purpose and a sense of belonging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my country: I pray that we will set aside our differences and come together, to help one another instead of tearing each other apart. I pray that those who pretend to be will find the courage to truly be what they think they are and hope to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For our leaders: Godly wisdom and protection and a return to serving rather than being served.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the world, that we could set aside our own desires and begin to help those who cannot help themselves, even if it\u2019s just a little: that we would value our lives and the lives of others more than money or religion or politics. I pray that the Prince of Peace would enter the hearts of each and every person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My prayer for us is that, if we meet, we will be friends: that somehow, with all that is going on in the great big crazy world, we might make a difference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I pray that whoever I meet will see and feel God\u2019s love and that they will come to know that love for themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My prayer for myself is that I will allow God to work in my life, to do the things that he wants to do. As it says in Jeremiah 29:11 (KJV), \u2018\u201cFor I know the plans I have for you,\u201d declares the Lord, \u201cplans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.\u201d Amen.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My prayer for you is that you will find love: that you will find it in yourself, and that it will overflow to those around you.
