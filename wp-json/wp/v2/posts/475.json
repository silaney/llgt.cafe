But they do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember that as a child, our family had a record player. It played 45\u2019s and the records were about 1\/3 the size of the larger records. The first record that I bought for myself was by Keith Green. I remember that I took all the money that I had at the time and \u2014 with the help of the cashier \u2014 purchased that album. I\u2019m not sure how many times I listened to it but knowing me, it was probably several.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My brother, on the other hand, had a job and so he purchased a sound system. I liked to use it too. He preferred groups like Meatloaf and others that I don\u2019t recall. I liked love songs from Styx, Chicago and Boston.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When CD\u2019s came out, I got one. It took a while before I actually got a CD player. Or maybe it was the other way around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My first CD was by Michael Card and I know I drove my sister crazy as I listened to it over and over. I know because she told me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping: having, owning, holding, possessing or maintaining. If you don\u2019t keep something, you sell it or give it away.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Records: any document \u2014 printed material \u2014 mental, analog or digital. A record may be a physical piece of paper, but it may also be a memory, a 45 album or a photograph. These are just some examples. A $1 bill is a record of a certain percentage of value based on something. It used to be gold, but I\u2019m not sure what it is now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First Corinthians tells us that love, among other things, \u201cit keeps no record of wrongs.\u201d It tells us that we may have other gifts and we may do great things, \u201cbut do not have love, I gain nothing.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bible also tells us that God is love. So, it could be said that if we do not have God, we do not have love and therefore we gain nothing from this life that we live.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s required to find God?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scripture: it could be Genesis 1: 1 that says, \u201cIn the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\u201d (KJV)<br>Faith: so if you believe in your heart what God says, you have part of it.<br>Confession: It\u2019s confession that, one, I am a sinner and that I need God\u2019s help and, second, that I put my faith in the completed work of the only Son of God. If Jesus was just a teacher or a good guy, he could\u2019t save anyone. And if you think about it, he really did clam to be equal to God and that\u2019s why they killed Jesus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t remember my prayer because I was too shy to pray out loud. I did believe in my heart, though, and the confession came soon after at baptism. And, if you don\u2019t know, baptism cannot save anyone. Tongues are not a sign of being born again; they are simply a gift for self edification and, perhaps, for the church. I think things like serving and teaching, giving to the church are more prevalent gifts these days. Healing would be nice, but I think it goes back to faith, not need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a sample prayer: \u201cGod, forgive me. I confess that I am a sinner and that I need Your forgiveness. I accept your gift of salvation that you offer because of the promise in John 3: 16 (\u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d \u2014 KJV). Thank you for this free gift.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you do this, you are sealed with the Holy Spirit, Saved and given eternal life. It\u2019s so simple, and adult can get it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have questions, please email me: ralfie517@gmail.com. Put \u201cQuestion\u201d in the \u201cabout\u201d line. If you have a prayer request, put \u201cPrayer\u201d. If you just want to let me know that you\u2019ve put your faith in Jesus, put \u201cYes.\u201d This will help me sort though all of the junk that I get to find what I really need to focus on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Resources:<br>KLRC Christian Radio: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.klrc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/www.klrc.com\/<\/a><br>Book of John PDF: <a href=\"https:\/\/content.wtsbooks.com\/shopify\/pdf_links\/9781433558955f.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/content.wtsbooks.com\/shopify\/pdf_links\/9781433558955f.pdf<\/a><br>Google \u2014 churches near me search: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=churches+near+me&amp;sxsrf=AJOqlzVVXWxJB7aelxcNfGiBOXyX5mw06Q%3A1676654624984&amp;ei=ILjvY--YO8m3qtsPw8WwsAQ&amp;oq=churches+&amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQARgBMgUIABCRAjIICAAQgAQQyQMyBQgAEJECMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDoKCAAQRxDWBBCwAzoHCC4QsAMQQzoECCMQJzoRCC4QgAQQsQMQgwEQxwEQ0QM6CwgAEIAEELEDEIMBOg4ILhCABBCxAxDHARDRAzoICAAQgAQQsQM6EQguEIMBEMcBELEDENEDEIAEOggILhCxAxCDAToICAAQsQMQkQI6CwgAEIAEELEDEMkDOgQILhBDOgcILhCxAxBDOgQIABBDOgsILhCABBDHARCvAToKCAAQsQMQyQMQQ0oECEEYAFDTGViKKmDpO2gBcAF4AIABpwKIAfoMkgEFMC43LjKYAQCgAQHIAQnAAQE&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=churches+near+me&amp;sxsrf=AJOqlzVVXWxJB7aelxcNfGiBOXyX5mw06Q%3A1676654624984&amp;ei=ILjvY&#8211;YO8m3qtsPw8WwsAQ&amp;oq=churches+&amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQARgBMgUIABCRAjIICAAQgAQQyQMyBQgAEJECMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgUIABCABDoKCAAQRxDWBBCwAzoHCC4QsAMQQzoECCMQJzoRCC4QgAQQsQMQgwEQxwEQ0QM6CwgAEIAEELEDEIMBOg4ILhCABBCxAxDHARDRAzoICAAQgAQQsQM6EQguEIMBEMcBELEDENEDEIAEOggILhCxAxCDAToICAAQsQMQkQI6CwgAEIAEELEDEMkDOgQILhBDOgcILhCxAxBDOgQIABBDOgsILhCABBDHARCvAToKCAAQsQMQyQMQQ0oECEEYAFDTGViKKmDpO2gBcAF4AIABpwKIAfoMkgEFMC43LjKYAQCgAQHIAQnAAQE&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Question: How could two little words have so many meanings?
