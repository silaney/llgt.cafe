I know that there are times when I do. Here are four ideas that may help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try going somewhere new: some place you haven\u2019t been before or, perhaps, haven\u2019t been in a while. It may be a library, a church, a coffee shop, a store or some other place. Try going some place where you might see someone you may know but haven\u2019t seen for a long time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are others around, try introducing yourself. You can tell someone else your name and ask theirs. You can add a little humor, too. Recently, I introduced myself saying, \u201cI\u2019m not running for the office of president, so please don\u2019t vote for me.\u201d You can also ask questions, like \u201cWhat is your favorite color,\u201d or \u201cIf you could go anywhere in the world, where would you go?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Questions are also a good way to deepen a relationship. Just don\u2019t move ahead of the conversation into uncharted territories too quickly. Unless you know someone well enough, it may not be a good idea to ask personal questions. It may be better to ask simple questions and build other questions based on the response that you receive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, remember things about the person that you want to know better. It may just be his or her name for starters. If that person has a wife or husband or children, find out their names and try to remember them. I worked at a place where we all had different days off and there were several people who I could remember when their weekends was coming up; I would wish each of them a happy Friday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are just a few things that you can do to find new friends and help build relationships. Real relationships require familiarity and that takes time. Don\u2019t be afraid to take the first step. Who knows, your next best friend could be around the corner.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you want more friends? I know that there are times when I do.
