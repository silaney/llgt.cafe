Chris closed his umbrella, showed his bus pass to the driver, and found a seat near the back of the bus. It was still early, so Chris closed his eyes in an attempt to take a nap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within a few stops, the bus was nearly full. A young lady boarded the bus at the next stop and, looking for a seat, sat by Chris. She was about Chris\u2019 age, and had a lovely smile. Chris looked up and said \u201chi.\u201d, but the conversation went no further.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Chris\u2019 stop both he and the young lady that he had sat by got off the bus. It was still raining, and Chris offered to let her share his umbrella. The two entered the museum, and began looking around. It wasn\u2019t long before the two bombed into each other, again, and Chris introduced himself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Chris,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shared my umbrella, earlier.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m Charlotte,\u201d said the young lady, brushing back her long, dark brown hair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two continued exploring the paintings of the museum, and the two began walking, together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI was thinking about getting a bite to eat,\u201d said Chris, \u201cwould you like to join me.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSure,\u201d said Charlotte, \u201cI\u2019m kind of hungry. There\u2019s a nice little sandwich shop next to my apartment,\u201d Charlotte continued.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSounds great,\u201d said Chris.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two left the museum, talking as they waited for the bus. It wasn\u2019t long before the rain stopped, and the sun came out. The bus arrived, and the two found a seat near the back of the bus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the sandwich shop, the two ordered turkey and Swiss on rye, and Chris ordered extra tomato. Chris and Charlotte found a seat at a table outside, and continued talking. Chris couldn\u2019t help but gaze into Charlotte\u2019s deep brown eyes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two finished their lunch, and exchanged phone numbers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI had a good time, Chris,\u201d said Charlotte.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d said Chris. \u201cMaybe we can plan on meeting at the museum next weekend.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSounds great,\u201d said Charlotte.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charlotte and Chris said goodbye and Charlotte headed off to her apartment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Was it love at first sight?
