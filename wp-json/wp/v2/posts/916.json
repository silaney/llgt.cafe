Have a budget, and stick to it. Plan your menus, and only buy what you can afford. Look for sales ahead of when you might need to make purchases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pay yourself<\/strong><br>Set money aside for your future self. Call if an emergency fund or a fun fund. Emergency funds should have anywhere from $1,000 to three months take home pay, or more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keep it simple<\/strong><br>One of the simplest ways to budget is to cash your check and put the money into envelopes. You may have envelopes for rent, food, gas and so forth. Each gets either a certain amount of money, or a percentage of your pay. If, for example, you have $100 for food, you have to figure out how to make that money last until next pay day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t know where to start, begin by writing out some of your goals. Make sure that these goals are realistic, and give them a deadline. Take a look at where you are, and figure out small steps that you can take to get to where you want to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reward yourself<\/strong><br>Each time you take a step towards your goal, or whenever you reach a goal, remember to reward yourself. It could be as simple as a little cheer. Congratulate yourself. Pat yourself on the back. These small rewards can make you feel better about the direction you are taking, and help keep you on the right path.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t put it off; the sooner you get started, the better. Make commitments to yourself, and respect yourself enough to stick to them. Your future self just may thank you for it.  Do these things and never forget that God is the one who provides for all of our needs.  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to our finances, there are a few rules that we should keep.
