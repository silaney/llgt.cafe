For me, it\u2019s food, shelter, clothing, transportation, work, relationships and and personal items. But if you look at where I live, you might think that I need a lot more than just that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A whole industry has popped up called self storage because of all of the things that we think we need. These self storage units aren\u2019t cheap but they can\u2019t seem to build enough of them. Some people have so many things that they buy their own unit and keep it on their property. If a home isn\u2019t enough, you can build a separate building.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why do we want or need so many things? Personally, I think it helps us fill in some of the holes left by a lack of relationships \u2014 the most important one being a relationship with our creator. If we can just get enough things, maybe we will be happy. What we really need is to know the God who created us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bible tells us that God loves us so much that He sent His Son to die on a cross so that we might have eternal life. Jesus warned us not to spend too much time collecting things on earth because these things don\u2019t last.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, my camera, is it a want or a need. For me, having a camera is a high priority want. I could choose any camera that I want but it has to fall within my financial means. I chose a digital camera because I don\u2019t have access to a darkroom. Photography helps me be creative and I think that\u2019s important. Will that last into eternity? Probably not. But I enjoy it now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m not suggesting you sell your belongings. But it is good to think about the things that really matter from time to time. What really matters to me? Relationships. I have my relationship with my Father in Heaven. But I could spend more time working on relationships where I am right now.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is it that we actually need?
