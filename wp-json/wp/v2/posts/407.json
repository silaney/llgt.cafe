Thanks to a couple of books that I picked up on <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3HHDnfU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Audible<\/a>, I\u2019ve discovered the importance of having a consistent morning routine. It doesn\u2019t have to be complicated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First things first. After waking up, I look at the clock. If it\u2019s before 4, or I\u2019ve gotten less than 5 hours sleep, I ask God if there\u2019s anything I need to pray about. I pray for anyone who comes to mind and I either get up or try to go back to sleep. Some times I just need a quick snack before going to back to bed. When I do get started, it\u2019s usually with a cup of coffee in my favorite coffee\/tea cup: two teaspoons instant <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3HHDnfU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">coffee<\/a>, stevia and lots of milk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have my <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3wNJfha\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vitamins<\/a> lined up on the kitchen table behind me. My checklist is on a dry-eraser board on the fridge next to the Bible verse that I read each morning \u2014 at some point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer. \u2014 Psalm 19:14 (KJV)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m a work in progress (WIP), so this is something that I hope will some day be true.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Music is a must, first thing in the morning. Right now, I am addicted to <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3HM1qdq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Audrey Assad<\/a> and to most (not all) of her songs. I could listen to her song, \u201cGood to Me\u201d for hours, which is a good thing, because I like to get a song stuck in my mind because it helps pass time while I work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Journaling is on my list and, while I wish reading were one of my loves, I find that it takes too much mental energy. That\u2019s where YouTube videos come in handy. If you look hard enough, you can find positive or helpful videos. YouTube has problems trying to figure me out, as I\u2019ve told it I don\u2019t like most of the channels that they recommend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as letters \u2014 real, hand written letters \u2014 seem to have become something from the past, it seems that email is taking the same path, in favor of texting and FaceTime. Of the two, I prefer a text. Apple\u2019s Messages is similar to texting, but only works between Apple devices. I can send someone a text from my phone and another from my tablet, and it doesn\u2019t matter to them which I send it from. But it matters to me which one they reply to because one will go to my phone and one will go to my tablet. I may not see one or the other for some time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Breakfast is usually between 11am and noon. FYI: 12M is actually noon. Yesterday, I had leftover tuna salad on a sandwich. It depends on what I have on hand. One day, I took brownie mix and made pancakes with peanut butter. I usually have eggs with cheese, since cheese is, after all, a vegetable in my book. One of my favorites is diced bacon, fried eggs topped with kimchi.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I begin my blog post by 11am. If I lack the energy, I find an old blog post that I can use, copy\/paste, and create an image for the website and for Facebook.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like to walk at least 10 minutes, if it\u2019s not too hot or absolutely too cold. I think, with the ice on the streets and temperatures around 20\u00b0F\/-6.66 (cold from hell, as some would say), it qualifies as too cold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By 1:30am, I\u2019m getting ready for work: shave, shower and putting my lunch box together. I keep everything else \u2014 keys, pens and earbuds \u2014 in a box on the TV table by the kitchen table.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may ask: \u201cBut why?\u201d I\u2019m glad you asked. I\u2019ve leaned that it\u2019s important, not only to stay focused, but to focus my heart and mind on the right things. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s easy, but it\u2019s worth it. I have a choice: I can either focus on all of the negative things, the things that I want to waist my time on, or I can focus on the things that will eventually get me where I want to be. The good news is that a walk to the fridge or the kitchen stove counts as a walk, in a pinch.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You won\u2019t see a video, but I do have a morning routine.
