I think I\u2019ve heard arguments for or against all of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some time, it has been said that cash is king. If you have money, you can take advantage of certain opportunities that may not come along very often. Cash gives you the opportunity not only to buy things, but to be able to invest, and it can make it easier to be able to make more money. But, just like anything else, money can be lost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gold can be a good investment. Right now, gold is just under $2,000 per ounce. But, I\u2019ve heard it said that if you need to buy grocery\u2019s, you won\u2019t be buying it with gold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stocks can be good. Over time, they can make a person a lot of money. Yet, just as stocks can go up in value, they can also go down in value. The thing about stocks as that, in order to get make a lot of money in a new stock, you have to recognize a winner before anyone else does. And, of course, you will have to have the money to invest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food is a good thing to have if there is some sort of natural disaster, or something else that cuts of the food chain. But food doesn\u2019t last forever, and you won\u2019t retire off of a food supply.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Education can be nice to have. Over time, an education can help you make more money. But with the rising cost of a college education and growing student debts, an education can be a burden that can weigh a person down for several years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A skill can be a good thing to have as well. Depending on your skill and what you are able to do with it, a skill could help a person make a lot of money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think? Which do you think is more valuable? Maybe you have some ideas, or something that you would like to add to the list.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What\u2019s better to have, cash, gold, stocks, food, education, or a skill?
