To some, it means grown up in a \u201cChristian nation.\u201d It means not being an atheist, a Muslim, a hinder or one of many other religions. To some, it means being a good persons, loving and accepting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I became a Christian just over 42 years ago and, at the time, I really didn\u2019t know much about my new found faith. Actually, I don\u2019t believe that my faith is something that I found but was something that was given to me. I wasn\u2019t looking for God, but God came after me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does it mean to be a Christian? Being a Christian is as overused and as misunderstood as the word love. \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d \u2014 John 3:16 (KJV)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, being a Christian means a few things. It means that I recognize that my sin separates me from a loving God and that this sin brings death. God is life, love and everything that is good and separation from God means separation from all of these things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, being a Christian means trusting God\u2019s word, that he is who he says he is and that what he says is true. God says that he love me; I believe him. God says that he loved me enough to send his son to die on the cross so that I might have eternal life; I believe him. God says that he will work all things to the good of those who believe; I believe him. I don\u2019t always understand or believe as strongly as I would like to, but I believe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>God didn\u2019t \u201cpick me\u201d because I was stronger or smarter or more popular than anyone else. In fact, I lack in many of these areas. If fact, the Bible says that he so loved the world and that \u201cwhosoever believeth\u201d can have eternal life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much that God accepts some and rejects others as it is that some just don\u2019t feel the need for God. We tend to see just the things that are in front of us and, if we have food, shelter, friends, intelligence and plenty of money, who needs God? But we all need God. We\u2019re all sinners in need of a savior.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>God doesn\u2019t say that we can earn eternal life through good works. The Bible does say that only God is good. We tend to judge ourselves by how we feel at the time, by our own standards, or by comparing ourselves to others. But that\u2019s not how God judges us and God\u2019s option is the only one that really matters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One problem is that we only see the present moment. And we don\u2019t see or know all things. We judge others when only God can know the heart of a man. We may think that we know everything that we need to know, but we don\u2019t. The only thing that we can do is the best we know how to do at the time. It\u2019s as true for you as it is for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>God gives us ten commandments, two of which are above all the rest: love God and love others. When I was a child, I thought that my parents didn\u2019t love me if they didn\u2019t let me have my way. But I eventually grew out of that. Today, there are still people, adults even, who still feel this way: that being loving is just accepting anything and everything. But, again, we are going by God\u2019s standards and not our own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bible says that there will be hard times in this life, and I believe it. But it also says that there will be rewards for those who put their faith in God and the son of God. I wish I could say that this life was going to be easy, but it\u2019s not. There are going to be things that we just don\u2019t understand, times when we don\u2019t have answers and times when it seems like nothing is going right. But God promises that, in time, it will all come together. It may be in this lifetime and it may not. Believing in God and trusting his word \u2014 loving him \u2014 that is what it means to be a Christian.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Being a Christian means different things to different people.
