Is it possible to go right by turning left enough times? The answer to both of these is yes. But they leave something unanswered. How many times does one have to turn left to be going to what would have been to the right, and how many times does it take someone to fail before succeeding?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer is, it\u2019s different for everyone. Walt Disney is just one example of someone who failed to success, but so is Thomas Edison. It took him about a thousand tries before he came up with the right material to put into the light bulb.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Failure can help point us in the right direction by helping us to see the wrong direction. But success is more than not failing, it\u2019s figuring out what really matters. I could become a successful bank robber, for example, but I know that is not something that I want to do. What I really want to do is to help others and not to hurt them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One way to shorten the time it takes to succeed is to find a mentor: someone who is or has already done the thing that you or I want to do. So, if you want to sell widgets, find someone who is a successful widget salesperson and ask that person to help you. Some people may offer classes and that is another form of mentorship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, if you or I aren\u2019t clear on what we want, it\u2019s going to be nearly impossible to know whether or not we\u2019ve found it. So, this is what I would do: put it in writing, and put as much detail as possible. Make a list of things that you want, describing each one in detail \u2014 limiting the list to four or five things \u2014 and then prioritize them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve created a business plan that may help. You\u2019ll find it below. Feel free to download it and make as many copies as you like.
