One problem is that we often don\u2019t know how much we don\u2019t know. At least that has been my experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I cannot remember all of the mistakes that I\u2019ve made: big and small. I\u2019ve tried to learn from them what I could in hopes of not repeating them, or at least not in the same way. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t always work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s easier to see how much others might not know, at least after we\u2019ve gotten a little more experience in a particular area or interest. Still, there is always going to be someone who knows more than we do, or at least thinks that he does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Proverbs 11:14 (KJV) reminds us that, \u201cWhere there is no counsel, the people fall;<br>But in the multitude of counselors there is safety.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There can be wisdom found in asking others for help, but not always. There will be times when others don\u2019t know the answer that we are seeking anymore than we do. But it never hurts to try. As they say, the only bad question is the one that we don\u2019t ask.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not knowing, or not having the knowledge that we need can affect every part of our lives. Knowing, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t truly help unless we are willing and able to properly apply what we know to any given situation. Often, we know right from wrong, but it can be far too easy to just follow our emotions, in spite of what we know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\u201d \u2014 James 1:5 (KJV)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We never do get to a point in our lives when we always make the right choice. Yet, we can learn from both our successes and our failures. Hopefully, we repeat the things that work, as needed, and avoid the things that don\u2019t. In the end, God is the only one who can judge right from wrong.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Years ago, a friend told me that we base our decisions on the information that we have at the time.
