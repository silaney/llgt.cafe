And though there are no prescribed ways to celebrate, here are a few ideas:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Work harder than you would normally work. Don\u2019t just bark orders, work. Work hard in honor of those who normally put 100% effort into all that they do.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Work like a dog: that is, take a nap, lie in the shade or on the couch.  A hammock works great, too.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Give your service dog a day off or, perhaps, a special treat.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Take your dog to a dog park.<br>Take yourself to a dog park and let your dog come along.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you don\u2019t have a dog, maybe it\u2019s time to get one. There is probably a local pet adoption agency that you can contact in order to find a dog.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Borrow someone else\u2019s dog for the day. Maybe you have a friend or a relative who wouldn\u2019t mind letting you borrow his or her dog for the day. The two of you can go for a walk, take naps together or, maybe, go for a swim at the lake.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever you decided to do, enjoy.
