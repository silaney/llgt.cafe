That\u2019s why so many relationships don\u2019t last. A lasting relationship needs a commitment to the other person that goes deeper and seeks to serve and love the other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cLove is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.\u201d \u2014 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 (NIV)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s nothing in that verse that talks about getting our own way or having things be perfect. In fact, if we keep looking for perfection, we will never find it. But if we seek to serve, whether it be others, or the God who created us, we will become more loving. And, as 1 Corinthians tells us, there is nothing is more important that we can do than love others.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What would your rather have?
