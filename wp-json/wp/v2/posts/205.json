Her are a few things that just might help you feel better. Though you may find some some of them to be addictive, and maybe even contagious, at least they are free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sleep<\/strong><br>Try to make sure that you are getting enough sleep. A lack of sleep can cause confusion and can elevate fear as well as other negative emotions. It can also cause us to act irrationally. There are some things that you can take to help you sleep ( I would recommend a warm cup of chamomile tea), or you can try some of the other suggestions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Breath<\/strong><br>When we are relaxed, we tend to take longer and deeper breaths. So, intentionally focusing on our breathing, breathing in for 8 to 10 seconds for example, holding that breath for about the same, and breathing exhaling for 8 to 10 seconds can have a calming effect on the body and mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Count<\/strong><br>I don\u2019t hear as much about counting sheep as I used to as an aid to go back to sleep, but I do find that counting slowly \u2014 1 to 10, or 10 to 1 \u2014 helps reduce my heart rate and helps me to relax. For one thing, it seems to be a distraction and can help me turn my mind from other things that may be racing through my mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Smile<\/strong><br>Try smiling, even if you don\u2019t exactly feel like smiling. This is not one that I use a lot, but I hear that it works pretty well. If this doesn\u2019t work for you, maybe you can picture someone else, someone that you love, smiling. Instagram is full of pictures of people smiling, and maybe you can find a picture of someone else smiling that helps make you feel better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dance<\/strong><br>Movement can help in multiple ways. If you can put on some music and just start dancing, I don\u2019t think you can help but feel better. If you can find someone to dance with, that\u2019s even better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Write<\/strong><br>You may not always have someone you can talk to, and you may not want to pass on your frustration, but you can write. Journaling works for me most of the time, but if I want to make sure that no one reads what I\u2019ve written, I may just create a Word or Pages document, type out the things that are on my mind, and delete it when I\u2019m done. It helps me because I am able to sort though my thoughts and to clear my mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Laugh<\/strong><br>Laughing can just about always help. I say just about always because there is that laugh of uncertainty, that awkward moment when you\u2019re not sure what else to do. I\u2019m talking about that laugh that comes from the gut. Warning, this one may be addictive, and it may be contagious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found a Christian comedian, Michale Jr., that I really like. Here is a link to one of his videos that I found on YouTube. It may just make you laugh, and it may make you cry, but it should make you think, and it should make you feel better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try one, or try them all. If you have your own suggestion(s), please share. And if you find these ideas helpful, please share them with others.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Feeling a little (or perhaps more than a little) stressed these days?
