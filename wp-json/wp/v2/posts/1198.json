If she\u2019s still alive, she would be 127 years old. Unfortunately her plane disappeared and Mrs. Earhart is presumed dead. Today is Amelia Earhart Day. And, though we could celebrate with cake and ice cream, there might be other ways to celebrate this day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, we could study the life of Mrs. Earhart, who was born in Kansas and grew up to do what women in her days dared not do. She entered a man\u2019s world of flying and conquered it. Unfortunately, the plane that set her free probably took her life. But what\u2019s worse, to die trying or to never attempt to do what you feel you were born to do? Each of us has to answer that for ourselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, we can make paper airplanes and fly them. If there\u2019s more than one person, we can compete to see whose airplane flys the furthers or stays in the air the longest.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third, we can watch a documentary on Amelia Earhart. I\u2019m sure there is something on iTunes or, at least YouTube.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally and, perhaps, more importantly, we can follow our dream, wherever it leads. Is there something that you\u2019ve wanted to do but have been too afraid to do it? Maybe you just haven\u2019t found the time. I don\u2019t mean cleaning the dishes or folding the clothes. It may mean saying \u201cHi\u201d to that someone you\u2019ve been afraid to talk to. It may mean taking a flight to some place you\u2019ve always wanted to go. Or it may just be time to check into the price of flights. Today might be the day to take that first step.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Faith comes to mind. Faith is the belief in something that we cannot see or that hasn\u2019t happened yet. It says that, if I do something, I\u2019ll be okay or safe and that it might make me happier. Fear says that I\u2019m going to die if I do my laundry or as a girl out to a movie. It\u2019s your choice: choose faith.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Amelia Earhart was born on July 24, 1897. If she\u2019s still alive, she would be 127 years old.
