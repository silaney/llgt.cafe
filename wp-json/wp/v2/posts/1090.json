And it\u2019s likely that our routine will change several times throughout our lifetimes. But there are times when we can feel stuck in a rut. I know that this is true for me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what do we do when when we feel like our lives are stuck \u2014 playing the same thing over and over like a broken record? Perhaps, it\u2019s time to try something new. It doesn\u2019t have to be anything big.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, deciding to write was something new. Yes, I had written before, keeping journals and doing other writing. I had tried to do a podcast but quickly lost interest. It just didn\u2019t seem like it was for me. Yet, I could write and I\u2019ve really enjoyed it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can, try to include others. But realize that others may or may not be interested in new pursuits. That\u2019s okay. They just may be headed in other directions or maybe they just need to remain where they are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can try varying forms of art: photography, drawing, painting, writing and even cooking are some examples of things that you may enjoy. Photography and writing are two of my favorites. And I love eating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may even take classes or find a group of people who are doing the same thing. It can be good to have others encourage you along the way. And, if you cannot find a local group, you can likely find others online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do feel like your in a rut, maybe it\u2019s time to try something new. You don\u2019t have to change your whole life. Maybe you just need to make one change. The good news is that you can start today.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It can be a good thing to have a routine.
