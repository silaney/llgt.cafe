Also, the light at the end of the tunnel has been turned off to conserve energy.  Actually, there are ways to cut expenses that may help with your finances. Here are some ideas that may help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use natural light whenever possible to help reduce your electric bill. You may be able to find light bulbs that use less electricity. Or, you may use a fan instead of air conditioning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using coupons may help when you go grocery shopping, but I find that they are mostly designed to make you buy things that you may not normally buy. Instead, I find it better to plan ahead and prepare ahead. Making a menu and a grocery list can help prevent buying those foods that you don\u2019t really need. Also, preparing food ahead and storing it for future use can help save both time and money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Budgeting is another way that you can use planning to save money. The further out you can budget your money, the better. You may find extra money, or you can find out that you really can\u2019t afford that $4 coffee every morning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carpooling can be another way to save money. It may take some effort to find someone whom you can share a ride with, but it may be worth it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look at your subscriptions and see if any of them can be reduced or eliminated. Hulu, for example has two levels: one with advertising and one without. If you subscribe to the one without advertising, you may find that your can put up with some advertising in order to lower your cost. You may also decide that you can drop some subscriptions, completely. You may not realize all the subscriptions that you have, but they are easily found on your bank statements, credit card statements, or online.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Saving Money Rumor has it that Monday may be eliminated due to budget cuts.
