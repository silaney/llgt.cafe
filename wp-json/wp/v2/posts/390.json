I have. I cannot by any means say that I have a clear picture of what heaven might be like, or what I might do when I get there. There may be some there I had no idea would be there and, sadly, there might not be some whom I was certain would be there. The longer I live, the more I realize that I am not heaven\u2019s gatekeeper, as if there were one, outside of jokes about people getting into heaven.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m not here to debate whether or not there will be a rapture: a time when believers are taken away to be with Jesus. I certainly hope there is, and I believe there will be. But it\u2019s not going to cause me to leave my faith if there isn\u2019t a rapture. Keep it in mind, Jesus is expected to show up unannounced and let us know it\u2019s time to go by tooting his horn. If it were anyone else, it might be considered rude, but not in this case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People describe the rapture and heaven in terms of a traditional Jewish wedding, where the groom comes for the bride suddenly and there is a week long wedding feast. The Bible says that Heaven is beautiful beyond anyone\u2019s imagination. And then there is the best part of Heaven: Jesus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d \u2014 John 3:16 (KJV)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The invitation is still out there. If you are considering becoming a flower of Jesus, there\u2019s no time like the present. Close to two thousand years ago, Jesus came down from Heaven, lived a perfect life on this earth as both man and God, and willingly gave his life on the cross to pay for our sins. But Jesus didn\u2019t stay in the grave. Instead, he rose back to life and returned to heaven. If you think heaven is by invitation only, consider yourself invited. I hope to see you there.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Have you ever wondered what Heaven is like? I have.
