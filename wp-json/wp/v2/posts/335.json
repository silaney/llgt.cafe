Any time you do something that is \u201cdifferent\u201d, there is likely to be someone who doesn\u2019t like it. Even if it\u2019s just that you are happy doing what you like, or that you are successful at what you do, there will be someone who points out what you are doing it all wrong, or that they don\u2019t like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also going to be people who just don\u2019t understand what you are trying to do. it wouldn\u2019t be hard for me to find someone who is obsessed with some of the latest video games, but to find someone who understands my passion for taking pictures or for camera gear, that is a challenge. For most, it beyond their comprehension that I could spend time posting or looking at other people\u2019s pictures in Instagram. They cannot imagine spending $500 or more on a camera or lens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to cooking, I\u2019ve learned that, if I cook for more than one person, there is a good chance that there will be something that someone doesn\u2019t like. I can eat just about anything. But when it comes to the music that I choose to listen to, I am very particular.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reality is that we should do whatever it is that we do because we enjoy doing something. If it\u2019s writing, then write, if it\u2019s drawing, then draw. It would be nice if everyone liked and praised you for your works of art, but it may not happen, and that\u2019s okay. As long as you\u2019re not breaking any laws, doing anything immoral or hurting anyone, and it\u2019s something that you enjoy, then keep going; don\u2019t quit just because someone else doesn\u2019t understand or appreciate your work.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>However you express your creative self, there is one thing that you should realize, if you have not already: not everyone is going to like, appreciate, or feel the same way about your work as you do.
