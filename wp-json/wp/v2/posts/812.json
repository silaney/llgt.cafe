Before money, wealth might have been measured by the number of cattle or sheep one owned, or one\u2019s place in the community. Still, there are other things to consider.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good health is one thing to remember when we think of being rich. No one, no matter how wealthy, can buy good health. Yes, someone with an abundance of money can afford healthier foods, but that person still cannot buy good health.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freedom is something else that cannot be bought. If we are free to make choices, to choose what we will do with our lives and what we will believe, then we are certainly rich in that area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we have all that we need: shelter, food and water, and if we are relatively safe from harm, we are rich. These things not only require money, but they have to be available and affordable. Now, not everyone chooses a traditional home, and some farm their own foods. Lots of people get their water from a well. These items are things that everyone needs and, if you can get them easily, you are rich.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opportunity can also make us rich. The United States of America has, at least in the past, been referred to as \u201cthe land of opportunity.\u201d It has been a place where people could come, have freedoms to choose what they want to do with their lives and maybe get an education. The financial possibilities have largely been limited only by one\u2019s personal drive and ambition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t forget love. I don\u2019t mean the love that is all too often portrayed in the movies and on television, but those that we are committed to. Love can feel great, but 1 Corinthians 13 tells us that love is so much more than a feeling. The book of James in the Bible tells us that, if we don\u2019t have love, we don\u2019t have anything. I don\u2019t think that there is any doubt that having love \u2014 loving others and having others who love us \u2014 makes us rich.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have enough money, great. But don\u2019t forget to remember the other things and to be thankful for them, too. King Solomon had everything. Yet, I don\u2019t think that all the things he had made him any happier than anyone else. Remember, we cannot always determine what life hands us, but we can choose what we do with it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Money and possessions are one way that we measure wealth, but this is only one way.
