If we think that the 2024 presidential elections will divide the United States of America, this war has the potential to divide the whole world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mostly, I\u2019m avoiding news on this war. But there is one person whose perspective I trust. So, whose side am I taking? Neither. I believe that both sides are wrong and that both sides are killing innocent people: men, women and children who have nothing to do with this war.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s complicated. The animosity between the two goes way back. And the situation seems bleak. Still, I pray. When I pray, I pray for both sides that the killing will stop and that God will help the most vulnerable. God can do what man cannot. God can bring peace. But I also believe that there is only peace though Jesus, the prince of peace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I pray: Father, help those who are hurting. Help those who have lost family members or have family who are in danger. Protect the children, Lord. You alone can bring peace. In Jesus name, amen.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last night, I watched a short update on the war in Israel and Gaza.
