I don\u2019t know if you have any other or because I don\u2019t want to be a normal person, but if you don\u2019t care, what you do and you don\u2019t know what you want, to do with me.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Merry birthday girl. I just wanted you and your friend that I was going to be able to come over and help. I have a lot of money. I just got home. I don\u2019t think you could be there in any case, but I just got a new dress. I just wanted you know I had some ideas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have to be there. I don\u2019t think you could have anything else for us that would help you out and we will focus our own things that are you going through to our own family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His disciples are also in the front. Maybe you can do it tomorrow. I have had to pay a little while for the first two weeks of this. Merrily is the day that we can choose to focus on our own way to our fear of ourselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meet us there at our church. If you are looking for a good game, you can learn more about it and then you can find something new. Happy big or how small it would be.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn\u2019t really make sense, but that\u2019s how it is, some times, when you try something new or different. There are going to be people who don\u2019t understand what you are trying to do, and there are going to be people who say that if it could be done, it would have been done already.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some times the best thing to do is to thank others for their advise\/opinion, and go ahead and do what you were going to do, anyway, whether others understand or not. If the Hadron Collider hasn\u2019t brought about the end of the world, you trying something new probably won\u2019t, either. And even if you fail, you can still learn something from your mistakes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I was curious to see what would happen if I typed random words on my Notes app keyboard, and this is what I got. \u201cHi there, I was thinking of your thoughts on your Christmas party and we will probably never have a chance to&nbsp;<a class=\"read-more\" href=\"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/just-curious\">&hellip;<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":273,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[41,46,29],"tags":[3],"class_list":["post-272","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-family","category-friends","category-think-about-it","tag-llgt"],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/272","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=272"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/272\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":274,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/272\/revisions\/274"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/273"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=272"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=272"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/llgt.cafe\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=272"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
