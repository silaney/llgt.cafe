And I can spend most or all of our time doing the things that I want to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This morning, I was watching a YouTube video by someone who has decided to spend the first part of her day with God. She\u2019s doing so because, though she spends time in prayer, she wants to show God that her relationship with him matters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if our relationship with God is where it should be, then our relationship with ourselves and with others will fall into place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bible tells us that the greatest commandment is that we love God with all of our heart and soul, and the second is that we love others as ourselves. If we fail to love God, if we fail to honor God, we are not going to see ourselves as we ought, and God\u2019s love will not flow through us to others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s easy to start the day with the things that we normally do and forget to spend time alone with God. Our lives are shaped, not by the things that we want to do, or by our hopes and dreams, but by the things that we do every day. Perhaps it\u2019s time I stop blindly going about my day and start living with purpose: to love and honor and worship God as I am intended.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I don\u2019t know about you, but I often fail to see things as God sees them.
