But there are going to be times that we are going to have to figure things out as we go. There are times when we won\u2019t have all of the answers when we start, and we may not even know what the final result may look like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was certainly that way for the first explorers who came to America. It\u2019s been that way for most explorers and entrepreneurs thorough history. And it\u2019s been that way for many of the artists to capture or create any form or art.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may be necessity that drives us to do what we do, or it may be a passion inside of us. Whatever it is, this force drives us beyond the stage of just thinking about doing something to actually taking steps necessary to get started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are certainly times when I would like to see the end from the beginning. When I face a problem, I would like to know that there really is going to be an answer that will take care of whatever challenge I face. But some times I just have to try things, and keep trying till I find something that works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas Edison is famous for his one thousand attempts at finding a filament for the light bulb. And rather than seeing his attempts as failures, and giving up after 999 tries, he persevered and finally found something that worked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may be that way with something that you want to do. You may have to learn as you go. You may have to learn from countless failures. Take this advise from Thomas Edison and countless of others who had to learn on their own. Don\u2019t give up. Also, take notes along the way so you don\u2019t keep doing the same things over and over. You may be just one attempt away from success.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s nice when we can learn from teachers or other people that we meet along the way.
