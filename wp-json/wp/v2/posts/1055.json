And hopefully, you can see an improvement that has taken place over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest change in my life happened when I put my faith in Jesus and asked Him into my life. I was just 14 at the time but I knew that I needed God to come into my life to begin making changes. Some things changed right away, while other changes have taken more time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My most recent job required a lot of changes. I had been in food service for most of my career but found myself in manufacturing. I\u2019ve been in my new job just over two years now and I can look back at all of the lessons that I\u2019ve learned along the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can look at my photography and, thought I thought I was pretty good to begin with, my skill level has come closer to what I thought it was at when I started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My typing ability has greatly improved since I first began typing, but my hand writing isn\u2019t as good. My skills as an artist have also declined with lack of practice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can track some of our progress by keeping a journal or a scrapbook. Some progress is harder to keep track of. And some times it seems that I\u2019m moving backwards when, in reality, it\u2019s probably my target is moving further down the road. It\u2019s pretty common that, as we get better at something, our goal also shifts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re just starting something, you may want to keep a journal or a scrapbook. If you\u2019re wanting to paint or draw, try to keep your first picture so you can compare it with your most recent work. Hopefully, you can see an improvement. And try to avoid comparing yourself with others.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Comparison really isn\u2019t a good thing, unless you are comparing yourself to what you used to be like.
