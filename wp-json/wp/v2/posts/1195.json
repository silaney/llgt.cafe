Now, it\u2019s a little too warm. I saw the same cat that I saw yesterday. I think he\u2019s looking for his home, but all of the apartment buildings look the same in that area.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that Jesus lives. And because He lives, so do I, through faith. The good news is that Jesus is coming back. The bad news is that He hasn\u2019t come back yet, so there are things that I still have to deal with that I would rather not have to deal with. Smile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon approved my first children\u2019s book: \u201cI like\u2026. Do you?\u201d Yeah. I\u2019m just waiting for them to put it into their store. I\u2019m hoping to begin working with Laura (my niece) on other books.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I thought that I had seen the next U.S. president in a picture in my newspaper, then I found out that she is running for president. I\u2019m not sure where she stands on anything. I\u2019m not sure if it matters what I know or think I know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last night, I used my Gym membership for the first time. I walked for about 22 minutes. I did three chin-ups and two partial ones. I did some other weight lifting, looked around came home to my bed. This morning, after my walk, I made a cheeseburger without the bread: protein for all the muscle I\u2019m building. Smile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.&#8221; &#8212; Psalm 1:1-3 (KJV)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dear Diary,The weather was nice when I went for my walk.
