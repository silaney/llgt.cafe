For some, a dream job would be something that would only take four hours a week, and would make thousands of dollars a week. For others, a dream job would be one where that would include being able to travel all around the world, while others work at a job that they may or may not hope with hopes of one day retiring.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think my dream job might be working as a travel photographer, traveling in an RV, and taking pictures or shooting video. Maybe I could photograph an occasional wedding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s sometimes difficult to know what we will like or not like until we try something. And things don\u2019t always turn out the way that we had hoped they would. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we shouldn\u2019t try.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A career should match the life that you want to live; the two shouldn\u2019t clash. If you want to spend a lot of time with your family, you probably shouldn\u2019t take a job or start a business that requires that you work 15 hours a day, unless you and your family are working together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if your goal is to make millions of dollars by the age of 40, you probably shouldn\u2019t take an hourly position making minimum wage, unless you are working a side job that makes a lot more, or you are able to make up the difference in the stock market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing is, we all have dreams and, unless we go after them, they will remain just that: dreams. When it comes to living our dream isn\u2019t how many times we fall off the horse, or how many obstacles that we come across, but that when we fall, we get back up and, no matter what, we don\u2019t give up.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I searched Indeed for \u201cdream job\u201d and came up with over 15,000 listings.
