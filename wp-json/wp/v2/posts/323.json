Below are nine tips that can help you wen it comes to menu planning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choose a time when you can write our your menu for the week, a month, or more. You can work alone or involve others to help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use a calendar, or some other form of worksheet to write or type out your meal plan. If you use a calendar, it will need to be large enough that you can write in all of your meals. If you can type something on your computer and print it out, you can place it where you can see it, like on the refrigerator.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talk with your grocer: especially those in the meat or produce departments. They can tell you what days that certain items, such as seafood, are delivered, and may be able to offer you a special price on full boxes of produce.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember to check your pantry to see what you already have and can use in some of your recipes. It may help to keep a running list of items that you have so that you don\u2019t have to keep looking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, look to see if you have any leftovers that can be incorporated into new recipes, such as making a stew out of that leftover roast beef. Make sure that you check items in the refrigerator on a regular basis to avoid waist. If you need, repackage items and move them to the freezer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to use like ingredients. If you are making chicken enchiladas for dinner, you can also have chicken salad sandwiches for lunch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make extra. It doesn\u2019t take much more time to double or triple your meal, and it can save you time in the long run. You can portion out these extra meals and eat them over the next few days, or freeze them for another week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t forget to look for sales. If you can, find out what\u2019s on sale before you go shopping.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, shop local and in season. If your community has a farmer\u2019s market, check it out to see what you can buy there. Also, look to see if prices very according to season, and buy accordingly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember to include snacks in your menu planning. Some flexibility is fine when it comes to menu planning, but try to stick to your plan and to your govern list. A little work up front may make the rest of your life a lot easier.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to meals, planning ahead can save both time and money.
