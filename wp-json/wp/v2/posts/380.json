It felt really good. It\u2019s not the first time that I\u2019ve trusted God with my fears, but I don\u2019t do it nearly often enough. The first time was after a major military exam. I had just taken it that day, and the failure rate was high. I was worried, but I decided to give my worry to Jesus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you have some worries of your own. I\u2019ve learned to avoid watching television. There is a TV at work and, other than the weather, it\u2019s mostly filled with death and misery and other things that I just don\u2019t want to dwell on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, it wouldn\u2019t do any good to give Jesus my fears if I hadn\u2019t first trusted him to take away my sins. The Bible tells us that we have all sinned. Romans 3: 23 KJV) tells us that \u201cFor all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.\u201d I could try to convince myself that I\u2019m not really that bad a person, but that wouldn\u2019t take away the fact that, by God\u2019s standards, we are all sinners. Yet, God, who created us, the God who will one day judge his creation, made a way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acts 16:31 (KJV) tells us, \u201cAnd they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.\u201d If we put our faith in Jesus who, tough he was equal with God, put on flesh to pay for our sins, then we will have eternal life. \u201cThat if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\u201d \u2014 Romans 10:9 (KJV)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s easy to forget, however, that the Bible also tells us, \u201ccasting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.\u201d \u2014 1 Peter 5:7 (KJV).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is, perhaps, these cares that we carry are behind many of the problems that we face today: poor health, both mentally and physically, as well as a number of addictive behaviors. We may want to stop doing something, but it helps us forget our problems, so we keep doing it. What if, instead, we gave our problems to Jesus?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s too early to know the long term results. I may have to keep giving my cares to Jesus, but I can do that. You can, too.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Last night, I gave all of my worries to Jesus. It felt really good.
