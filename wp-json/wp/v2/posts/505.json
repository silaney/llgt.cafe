Well, I don\u2019t own any currents and am pretty sure that I never have. I didn\u2019t recognize the sender, either, so I put the letter in the not mine stack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This morning, I was given news that will impact my income in a negative way for at least three months. Perhaps the worst part of this is that there were three groups of people who could have given me this information more than two weeks ago. Two of them said nothing about the matter, while the third led me to believe that the opposite was true.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Miss communication happens all of the time. It is talked about a lot in the Bible. In the garden, the serpent clearly misrepresented the truth. At least twice in David\u2019s life, there were issues with communication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was frustrated, but I did not overreact. As far as whether anyone had any ill intent, or intention to mislead, I doubt it, but to make that sort of judgement is above my pay grade. What is boils down to is that God is my provider, and I have to trust that he will provide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joseph was put in a terrible situation and by his own family. Clearly, there was ill intent. In fact, some of his brothers wanted Joseph dead. But when Joseph was clearly in a position to take revenge, he said, \u201cBut as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.\u201d Genesis 50:20 (KJV)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>James 1:17 (KJV) says, \u201cEvery good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.\u201d To complain about how things turned out could very well be complaining against God. And, if there really is a problem, I have to believe that God is big enough to take care of it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Resources:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/<iframe sandbox=&quot;allow-popups allow-scripts allow-modals allow-forms allow-same-origin&quot; style=&quot;width:120px;height:240px;&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; src=\u201c\/\/ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com\/widgets\/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;OneJS=1&amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;source=ss&amp;ref=as_ss_li_til&amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;tracking_id=llgt-20&amp;language=en_US&amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;region=US&amp;placement=B09XQF59K9&amp;asins=B09XQF59K9&amp;linkId=18c736a477b0a71abf2951643a2751eb&amp;show_border=true&amp;link_opens_in_new_window=true&quot;><\/iframe>&#8221; target=&#8221;_blank&#8221; rel=&#8221;noreferrer noopener&#8221;>Locking Journal<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/<iframe sandbox=&quot;allow-popups allow-scripts allow-modals allow-forms allow-same-origin&quot; style=&quot;width:120px;height:240px;&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;\/\/ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com\/widgets\/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;OneJS=1&amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;source=ss&amp;ref=as_ss_li_til&amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;tracking_id=llgt-20&amp;language=en_US&amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;region=US&amp;placement=B079B7PJMV&amp;asins=B079B7PJMV&amp;linkId=51f37216aa78df4028b6fa8a30b78e67&amp;show_border=true&amp;link_opens_in_new_window=true&quot;><\/iframe>&#8221; target=&#8221;_blank&#8221; rel=&#8221;noreferrer noopener&#8221;>The Five Love Languages<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code><\/code><\/pre>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I checked the mail and there was was a letter marked \u201cCurrent Owner\u201d.
