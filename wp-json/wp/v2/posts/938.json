We cannot get rid of our problems that we face in life, and we cannot choose, for the most part, what problems we have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, we can make poor decisions in certain areas of our lives that lead to problems in these areas. Yet, we cannot choose our parents or how we are brought up. We cannot choose our genetics or the lessons that we are taught along the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Proverbs 22:6 (KJV) says, \u201cTrain up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve heard it said that much of what we learn, we learn by the time we are just two years old. Likely, what we learn at this age, consciously or not, affects many of our habits, our behavior and our relationships.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we grow up, we hear things repeated, or we tell ourselves things over and over again. We learn to believe these things about ourselves. Sadly, many of the things that we grow to believe may not be true.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is true that we cannot run from our problems. We can try. We can exchange one problem for another. Maybe the new problem with be better than the old one but maybe not. The important thing, though, is that we don\u2019t give up and don\u2019t quit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Romans 8:31 (KJV) reminds us, \u201cWhat shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, we cannot run from our problems, but we can learn to face them with the God who created all things. And in spite of how things may look at times, nothing is impossible with God.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There is something that I have learned over the years.
