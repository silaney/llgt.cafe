Now, I have a choice. I can take the day off from writing, or I can just sit down and write.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several things that we can base our decisions on: things like priorities, values and emotions. And it\u2019s likely that we make many of our choices base on more than one of these things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Commercials show us a picture of an amazing looking picture of a burger or a pizza, not because their food looks that amazing, but so that we will remember then the next time we are hungry. The commercial may even make us hungry, so that we may associate being hungry with wanting that food.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The things we remember \u2014 friends and co-workers, gatherings or events \u2014 we remember most for how they make us feel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is that emotions are often a poor source of guidance when it comes to decision making. Say, for example, I really want to buy something, but don\u2019t have the money. I can try to find a better price, I can wait and save up for what it is that I want, or I can buy it on credit, assuming that I have the available credit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some times, we have to put off doing the things that we want to do. Other times we may need to do the things that we don\u2019t really feel like doing. It\u2019s called self control, and our level of self control, along with other determining factors, will help us in our decision making and help guide our actions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with everything else, I like to write things out: get it on paper so that I can better sort things out.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I don\u2019t feel much like writing, today.
