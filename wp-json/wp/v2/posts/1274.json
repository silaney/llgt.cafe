Also, they offer something for $10 dollars that helps me to know some things about myself, like bone density and body fat. I\u2019m not sure all that it does, but I\u2019m interested in knowing more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do know a little about diet. And I have learned a little about overall fitness. What works for someone else, however, may not work for me. And the thing that works for me may not work for you. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to get the advise of a professional.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also good to have a goal. Not only can a goal give us clear direction, but it can help us to continue when motivation seems low.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Questions, comments?
