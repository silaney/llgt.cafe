What I do really does matter. Today, I plant the seeds that I will reap in the tomorrows to come. So, what is it that I do, or at least try to do first thing in the morning?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, I read a bible verse. Psalm 143: 8 (KJV) says, \u201cCause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I drink water, or lemon water, which helps refresh the bodies fluids.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I take vitamin D or a multi vitamin which can help mood in addition to having other health benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also listen to music. Right now, I\u2019m listening to Audrey Assad. It\u2019s calming and helps me to remember what really matters \u2014 a relationship with the living God.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I remember what I am thankful for: past, present and things to come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what I do first thing. I also write, go for a walk and often take pictures. What is it that you could do first thing in the morning to help you get off to a good start?
