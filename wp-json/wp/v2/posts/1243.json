It\u2019s true. I just wrote it, so it must be true.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No. Seriously, rumors and gossip don\u2019t actually help you or your business make money. Quite the opposite is true; rumors and gossip can hurt your finances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mainly, gossip can cause you to make the wrong financial choices. Rather than knowing what is really going on, it\u2019s possible to get inaccurate information from various sources. I don\u2019t know how many times the stock market was going to crash \u2014 and it didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know how many times banks were doomed and yet banks still exist. Predicting a market or a financial crash is like predicting the next \u201cgreat\u201d quake to hit California. Even when you think you know, you really don\u2019t know.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone may say, \u201cthis business has done well in the past, so they are certain to do well in the future.\u201d This may lead us to buy their stocks: stocks that may be doomed to go down because of information that I have not been given. When it comes to advise on buying stocks \u2014 or anything else \u2014 it\u2019s best to get more than one opinion. For example, I no longer buy supplements on Amazon without getting more than one opinion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do we know what is a rumor or just plain gossip? It can be hard to tell. One way to know is if someone has to whisper it. Another way is if someone uses works like \u201ccould\u201d or \u201cmight\u201d but makes it sound more like \u201cwill\u201d: this will help you make more money or will help you live a healthier life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember seeing an add for magnesium that said that this product helped someone sleep much better. After buying magnesium from another source, I watched a YouTube video that said it can help a limited number of people. It seems that I wasn\u2019t one of them. I didn\u2019t spend a lot of money and I can still use the product. But it certainly hasn\u2019t helped me sleep better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, rumors and gossip can hurt you, your relationships and your business. You may not be able to keep others from spreading rumors about you, but you can put an end to a rumor that goes your way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, gossip is no good and it can do nothing but hurt others, whether it be financially or personally. The Bible clearly warns against spreading rumors for that very reason. So, if you are tempted to spread gossip about someone, stop, and consider how you might feel if someone said the same thing about you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Did you know that today is National Gossip Day and that gossip can help you or your business make money?
