It\u2019s faster or smaller than the one before it and it can do things that we only hoped for just a few years ago.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you find it easy to save money and you enjoy doing it. I have done a little investing, and that\u2019s kind of fun. Trying to pick the right stock and sometimes getting it right is kind of fun. But I don\u2019t find saving all that exciting and, most of the time, I find it really hard.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s too easy to focus on the things that I want or need now. When I was in my twenties, I wasn\u2019t thinking about when I would be in my forties or fifties. And when I was in my twenties, I had no idea what I would need at this time of my life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schools leave us may teach us the math needed to balance our bank accounts, but the really don\u2019t teach us anything about our finances. For many, college is a time of getting into debt, and credit card companies are happy to give most of us credit as long as we have a pulse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe what we should do is make saving money fun. Maybe we could find a way to make a game out if it, like a board game or something. Maybe we could compete with others to see who is able to save up the most money. Just a thought.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really, when it comes to our finances, we need to start with figuring out which direction that we want to take our lives. Without direction, it is hard to get anywhere.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you truly want to save, it takes a plan. Like taking a road trip, you need to know where you wan to go so that you can make a plan to get there. Remember, however, that plans can change. There may be roadblocks and detours to your financial plans, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you have to give up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other thing, whether we have a little or a lot, we need to trust God with our money. After all, it belongs to God, anyway. It may or may not be exciting giving a part of our money back to God and his work though the church, but God does promise a peace that passes all understanding to those who put their trust in him.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Somewhere, someone is working on the latest thing that we all need.
