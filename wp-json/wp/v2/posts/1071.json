Inside was a diamond ring and a note.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dearest Rebekah,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had hoped to give you the ring in person, but I cannot wait. If you accept my proposal for marriage, please take the ring. If not, please leave it on the counter and I will know of your decision. Either way, I want to let you know that I love you and that I respect whatever choice you make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rebekah took the ring out of the box and slipped on her finger before continuing to read.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good. Now, I need you to go to the library and look for anything by William Godwin. Please, don\u2019t delay. I look forward to returning to you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Love always,<br>Charles<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PS: I was the only son of my father.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rebekah\u2019s class went well, but seemed to pass a little slower than most. Some of Rebekah\u2019s students noticed the rock on her finer, but no one asked about it \u2014 until one young girl dared to ask.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWho gave you the ring,\u201d asked a young lady named Sandy?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Rebekah, \u201cjust a friend.\u201d But the bell rang as she spoke those last words, and she and her students were off to the races.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Rebekah arrived at The Library, she parked and went in. And when she noted that the few librarians seemed to be busy, she looked around. Spotting a computer, Rebekah sat down and began typing in an internet search.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWilliam Godwin I was the only son of my father\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google came back with \u201cAbout 12,300,000 results (0.54 seconds).\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chapter 2: Off to London<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, since her trip to Paris, Rebekah had decided to keep a suitcase in her car with enough things for a week. And, phoning the school to request the rest of the week off, Rebekah took off for the airport.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019d like to go to London,\u201d said Rebekah, handing the young woman at the counter her passport and putting her luggage on the counter. A new DSLR hung on Rebekah\u2019s shoulder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the airport terminal, Rebekah met a family of two \u2014 mother, daughter \u2014 from north Idaho, and a young man named Robert returning to his flat in London. On the flight, Rebekah made a new friend \u2014 a five year old girl named Lily Grace, who did most of the talking on the way to London. It was Lily\u2019s second flight and her first trip to America. Lily\u2019s accent gave her away as someone from Ireland. It seemed strange carrying on a conversation with Lily, especially since she was so young. Yet, it did help pass time for the both of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was no one waiting for Rebekah at London\u2019s Heathrow. After finding a bus, Rebekah managed to find a hotel in the south part of town, where she was able to get some much needed sleep before going out for dinner at a small London cafe that was down the street from the hotel. There were other places to choose from \u2014 American chain restaurants \u2014 but Rebekah wanted to get a taste of London on her short visit. However, it was late and Rebekah had hardly slept on her journey. London would have to wait till tomorrow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chapter 3: A Chance Meeting<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hotel where Rebekah stayed had a complimentary breakfast. The hot tea was comforting and the warm croissant went down smoothly with strawberry jam. It was a dream. Leaving her plate on the table, Rebekah headed for the hotel\u2019s front door.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Rebekah headed prepared to exit the hotel, someone called her name. Forgetting what she was doing, she turned around to see who was calling her. But as she turned to look forward, again, she ran right into the door what she had planned to walk though, nearly knocking her out and sending her to the floor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, out of the blue, a hand reached down and helped her up. It was Robert from the flight to London.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI was here,\u201d said Robert, \u201cto see a friend. But then I saw you and I thought that we could spend some time tougher.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThat would be nice,\u201d said Rebekah, more than a little embarrassed at running into the door.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHave you had breakfast,\u201d asked Robert?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d answered Rebekah, \u201cbut I could go for a cup of tea.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d said Robert, \u201cme too.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rebekah continued, \u201cI have just four more days.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBefore what,\u201d Robert asked?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBefore I fly back to Boston.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Robert, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to make the most of your stay, then.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d said Rebekah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGood,\u201d said Robert.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chapter 3: Off to a Good Start<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert brought Rebekah, not to a street level cafe but to a small cafe at the top of a department store. It was nice and, in spite of having had breakfast, Rebekah picked up a cucumber and cheese sandwich on white bread from the buffet. Robert paid for breakfast and the two sat by a poster of the Eiffel Tower.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIs there anything that you want to see while you are here,\u201d asked Robert?\u2028<br>\u201cNo,\u201d said Rebekah, \u201cnot really.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019ll need to see Big Ben,\u201d said Robert.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnd Parliament,\u201d added Rebekah, but Robert didn\u2019t get the reference.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s also Tower Bridge and Piccadilly Circus,\u201d added Robert.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two finished breakfast and, after a short walk, found an entrance to the London Underground.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMind the gap,\u201d said the recording when the train arrived at their station.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMind the gap,\u201d repeated Rebekah, smiling. \u201cI like it.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two took seats by the train\u2019s entrance and got up three stops later, before taking a short walk thought Green Park to Buckingham Palace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d said Rebekah, \u201cbut I wouldn\u2019t wan to have to clean the place. And the electric bill\u2026.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHand me your camera,\u201d said Robert, \u201cand I\u2019ll get your picture. Beautiful,\u201d added Robert. \u201cAnd the palace doesn\u2019t look bad, either.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert seemed a natural with the camera, so Rebekah let Robert take most of the pictures. She also let a man who was passing by photograph the two of them in front of the palace before stopping by a market for sandwiches and drinks, which they took back to Green Park for lunch. Rebekah fed bread crumbs to the pigeons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThank you,\u201d said Rebekah, \u201cit\u2019s so nice to have someone to spend time with.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d replied Robert.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After lunch, the two found a tour bus and rode it for about an hour as it went though the streets of London. The two walked around for a couple of hours before taking a ride that took doubt 20 minutes. They got off about a mile and a half away from where they had gotten on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this,\u201d asked Rebekah?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMy daughter, Sarah,\u201d said Robert, \u201cgoes to school here. She\u2019ll be ten next month.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTen,\u201d asked Rebekah?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTen, going on 20,\u201d replied Robert.<br>\u201cSarah,\u201d said Robert, \u201cthis is our guest from America, Rebekah.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cShe\u2019s pretty, daddy,\u201d said Sarah. \u201cIs she going to have dinner with us?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert looked at Rebekah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMy wife died two years ago and, so, Sarah is trying to find a new wife for me.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cShe wants a mom,\u201d asked Rebekah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cYes,\u201d answered Robert.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI would love to have dinner with you,\u201d added Rebekah, \u201cif it\u2019s okay with your dad.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThat would be lovely,\u201d said Robert and Sarah, in unison.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt would be,\u201d said Rebekah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another bus arrived and, two bus transfers later, the three arrived at Robert\u2019s and Sarah\u2019s home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll make dinner,\u201d said Sarah, \u201cso you two can spend some time together.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSarah\u2019s quite the match maker,\u201d said Rebekah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cShe misses her mum,\u201d replied Robert.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chef Sarah prepared a wonderful meal of macaroni and cheese with hotdogs. It was amazing and Rebekah ate everything on her plate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After dinner, Robert walked Rebekah to her hotel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d said Robert, trying to give Rebekah a goodnight kiss. Rebekah dodged, however, before entering her room.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGoodnight,\u201d said Rebekah as she turned and left. It wasn\u2019t that she wasn\u2019t attracted to Robert. It was just that her love for Charles was so strong.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chapter 4: The Next Day<br>Rebekah got up early and had breakfast at the hotel. While she sat at the hotel\u2019s restaurant, Robert walked in and sat at the table with Rebekah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI want to apologize for last night,\u201d said Robert. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have tried to kiss you.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d said Rebekah. \u201cI just\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnd to make up for it,\u201d continued Robert, \u201cI\u2019d like to invite you over for dinner. I\u2019m making lamb raan with potatoes and green beans. I \u2014 we would love to have you back for dinner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThat sounds wonderful,\u201d said Rebekah. &#8220;I have to do research at the library. I can meet you and your daughter for dinner when I\u2019m done.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cGreat,\u201d replied Robert. \u201cIs there anything I can help you with?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNo,\u201d answered Rebekah. \u201cBut thank you.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d added Robert. \u201cSee you about 5:30ish?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it for the world,\u201d said Rebekah. \u201cOh, and I have to get ready to go to the library. I have a lot of research to do.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOn what,\u201d asked Robert.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An author named William Godwin,\u201d answered Rebekah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOh,\u201d said Robert, \u201cis he any good?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replied Rebekah. \u201cHe died a long time ago.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOh, well,\u201d said Robert, \u201cbest of luck to you. See you around 5:30. Okay?\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOkay.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Robert was off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A shower and a change into a new wardrobe later, and Rebekah was off to the library. Rebekah arrived at the library early and they weren\u2019t open yet, so she spent half an hour people watching, walking around and photographing the area around the library for half an hour. When the library opened, Rebekah went inside and, fining books by William Godwin, took them to one of the tables and began reading. There were eight books and, starting with \u201cDamon and Delia\u201d, Rebekah began reading. It was when she was reading \u201cFleetwood\u201d that a note fell out from between the pages. Rebekah picked it up and began reading.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dearest Rebekah,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I cannot explain how I know, but now I know that you love me because you did not allow Robert to kiss you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enjoy the rest of your stay in London and give Sarah a hug for me when you see her, again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Love,<br>Charles<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>PS: Sarah will be a great chef some day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rebekah took the note and held it to her heart before putting it in her hand bag. It was almost 5, so she went to Roberts house, telling Sarah what Charles had told her and giving Sarah a big hug.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI know I\u2019m going to be a chef when I grow up,\u201d said Sarah, \u201cbut how did you know.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cA little bird told me,\u201d said Rebekah.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert made dinner, but Sarah helped.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rebekah stayed for two more days before returning to Boston. Rebekah spend one full day with just Sarah, taking her to have her nails and hair done, before going to out to lunch and to the cinema. Sarah loved it and so did Rebekah. It was so hard for Rebekah to leave Sarah behind. But she had to get back home \u2014 to her school, and to her students.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chapter 5: Back home<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Monday that Rebekah returned to work, there was a small box with a crucial glass rose. Rebekah didn\u2019t know who had made it or how, but it was beautiful. A stem of gold held the petals together and there were two gold leaves. There was also a note:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dearest Rebekah,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am yet closer to returning home, and I will let you know more in my next note. Just know that I love you more than any other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Love always,<br>Charles <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Chapter 1: Another Letter There was a small package sitting on Rebekah\u2019s desk when she arrived to prepare to teach her English class that Monday morning.
