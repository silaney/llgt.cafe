Take a piece of paper, and divide it into four sections. You can draw four lines or fold it four ways. Index cards will work, too. Whatever works best for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, put these four headers in each of the four sections: Don\u2019t want, Want, Have and Need.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don\u2019t Want<\/strong><br>This is where you put the things that you don\u2019t want: debt, overdrafts at your bank, being short on funds, having to wait to buy the things that you want. These are just a few examples. You might be tempted to start with a list of things that we want, but it might be better to start with a list of the things that we don\u2019t want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want<\/strong><br>Take the things that you don\u2019t want and turn it around. If you don\u2019t want to have to buy the things that you want or need, put \u201cto be able to buy the things that I want\/need.\u201d If you wrote that you don\u2019t want debt, put that you want to be debt free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Have<\/strong><br>This is the list of things that you have. It can include resources, but it can also include liabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Need<\/strong><br>This is a list of the things that you need but don\u2019t already have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say, for example, you don\u2019t want to keep your current vehicle for more than one more year. And you don\u2019t want to take out a loan to buy a new\/used one. You want a new car, and you want to save up for it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps, you know that you want to find a vehicle for about $15,000. You may already have $5,000 saved up, so you will need to save up just over $833 a month for the next 12 months. Maybe that seems like a lot to set aside. You can revise your list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s another example. Maybe you don\u2019t wan to stay home for the Christmas after next. You may decide that you want to go to Hawaii. If you decide that the trip will cost around $3,000, you are going to need to save up around $250 per month, and more if you want to book your flight early.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t want to have debt, and I do want to pay off my Les Schwab account. Les Schwab is a tire and auto center. They do alignments, breaks and a few other things related to a car\u2019s suspension. I have a balance of about $16, and almost a month before my next payment is due. Therefore I need about $16 dollars to pay off my balance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wish this were all I owed, but it\u2019s a good place to start. Let me know if you find this tool helpful. I know that I plan to work more on my own list.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Don\u2019t want, want, have, need Here\u2019s an idea for your budget.
