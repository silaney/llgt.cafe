I\u2019ve been baking long enough to know that baking bread just takes a few ingredients. Unlike the bread at the store that has a list of 20 to 30 ingredients, home made bread just has a few: flower, water, yeast or some other leavening agent, unless it\u2019s kosher, along with a few other optional ingredients, and time in an oven or furnace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to personal finances, what it boils down to is doing a few things right, over and over again over a long period of time. The better of a start that we can get, and the more consistent that we are over time, not acting in faith one moment and fear in the next, the better we are likely to be in the long run.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to do is to have a plan. Part of this is not only knowing where the money that comes in will go but also that there will be money left over. It means having an overall plan for one\u2019s life so that there\u2019s no spending on the things that won\u2019t take you where you want to go. It means knowing yourself to realize that that fishing boat may not be the best purchase or that that trip to Hawaii can wait another year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It means that, if you plan to start your own business, that you are willing to put in the effort and allow for the time that it can take to start a new business. It may seem like some people have been able to start making money right away but, if you listen to them, they will tell you that it took, in most cases, years before they were making the kind of money that they were making. Often, they are the ones making the money because everyone else gave up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, budgeting is part of the planning process, but even the best budget is no good if you don\u2019t follow it. A budget is simply a road map for where you want to go. If you don\u2019t know where you want to go, or if you don\u2019t follow the map, it simply won\u2019t work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second key is to spend less than you take in. It\u2019s not enough to have credit available at the end of the month, you need to have real money that you can use if needed. This means planning not only for the monthly bills but for the unexpected: job loss, emergency expenses and alike.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, you need to invest. These days, there are so many ways to invest, even if it\u2019s just sweat equity, or working extra hard so that you have extra money. Whether it\u2019s sweat equity or some other form of investing, if you fail to invest, you will either not make any progress or you will fall behind over time. You can start at any time, but the earlier that you start, the sooner that you will be able to get where you want to be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stock market has never been easier to get into than now. If you are to do well, however, you have to do your research. Otherwise, your investing odds are likely no better than at the casino. Housing can be a great area to invest, but it also requires a lot of work. You or someone that you hire have to collect rent and take care of the units\/homes. Plus, you have to work with banks and sellers, getting not only the best price but the best interest rate. You have to be able to take risks with other people\u2019s money and, if things take a turn for the worse, you could be responsible for repaying a whole lot of money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You, yourself could be an investment. Education is just one form of investment. If used properly, an education could double the money that you would have otherwise made. Or, it could just leave you paying off a student loan for years. My initial student loan was just under $30 thousand, but I hear of people who have loans that are closer to $150 thousand. However, I also heard of someone who had a $90 thousand loan who was able to pay off his student loan in a matter of a few years, simply by working harder at finding better jobs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t need a bunch of head knowledge to do well financially. You do, however, need to do certain things and do them well. It begins with knowing where you are and where you want to go. Most importantly, it begins with you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In a way, finances is like baking.
