Most likely, we will never have or do all the things that we want, and we will never fully be the person that we hope to be. If we reach one goal, we will probably find another. There are some who seem to be perfect, who look perfect on the outside, or seem to have everything, but if you could get close enough, you would see the struggles that these people face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s realistic to think that we can be happy all of the time, but there are things that we can do that will help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, we can set as one of our goals to be more thankful. Though being \u201cmore thankful\u201d may not be measurable, writing in a gratitude journal ever day is. So is thinking of five things that we can be thankful for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can also decide that we will do more more of the things that make us happy. Below are some examples of things that we can plan to do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>go out to eat once a week.<br>go fishing twice a month.<br>take the kids to a movie once a month.<br>cook my favorite meal once a week\/month.<br>plan at least one vacation.<br>spend at least an hour a week on your favorite hobby.<br>find ways to be more social, and find ways to be with friends at least once a week\/month.<br>join a club where you can meet others.<br>find a form of exercise that you enjoy and do that at least once a week.<br>read a new book once a month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can also find happiness in doing things for others. Visiting family or friends, or even trying to get to know the neighbors can help make us happier. Baking and bringing cookies or pies to someone is just one example of something we could plan to do once a month. You may also find somewhere to be a volunteer worker. There are so many places to volunteer and that would be grateful for the help.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It may seem strange, but the best path to happiness may not be to decide to be happy.
