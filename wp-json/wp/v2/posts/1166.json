Whether you currently have a personal chef or you can barely afford your next meal, this day is for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, really. Having a personal chef may be a great idea and, if you are thinking about hiring one, the prices may be better than you thought. If another PBJ sandwich seems on the horizon, this information could help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want the services of a personal chef, these tips could help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Figure out a budget. Is your food budget $10, $100, or $1,000? It\u2019s important to know. And, if need be, you can use cash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collecting coupons may help reduce the cost of groceries. I find basic ingredients \u2014 eggs, flour, milk and such \u2014 work best. Add a few ingredients, and there are so many things that you can make.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plan your meals, based on simple recipes. The simpler the foods, the more likely you are to stick to the plan. Some things, like a dry pancake mix, can be made up ahead of time. A planner may come in handy, where you can plan a shopping day as well as menu options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: it\u2019s better to have extra options instead of having too few and having to go back to the store to buy one or two items (snacks).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some options:<br>Oatmeal<br>Ground beef<br>Burger Buns<br>Carrots (cooked or uncooked)<br>Noodles<br>Soups<br>Mixed Greens<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are just a few things that you can buy. The thing to remember is to buy according to the menu plan and to the budget. Keep in mind that food often costs more than we expect. It may be better to overestimate the cost of food.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One helpful purchase might be containers. You can portion out food and place it in storage: the pantry, fridge or freezer. If you like, you can either label these containers with \u201cUse By\u201d dates, the name of the item, or the date and meal that you intend to use it. Some things freeze well, while others don\u2019t. Some things, like mixed greens, may need to be made into a salad at the last minute.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So many recipes are available online. If you are in the mood for chicken, see if you can buy chicken in bulk, even if you have to portion it out and freeze it. Just don\u2019t do as I did once and leave it out overnight. Oops.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep a running list of groceries and, remember, you don\u2019t have to buy everything on the list: just what you absolutely need and can afford. Soup may mean canned, or fresh ingredients for the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These tips from a person chef wanna-be are free and could save you a lot of money. Of course, you can also go out to eat. Restaurants these days are struggling. Just don\u2019t make it your job to keep them in business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me know your ideas. Thanks, in advance.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today is National Personal Chef Day This is exciting.
