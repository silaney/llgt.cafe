Now, having been in food service for over thirty years, I\u2019ve made a number of omelets in my lifetime, and I\u2019ve seen a number of them made as well. Below are some familiar and not so familiar styles of omelets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>American Omelet<\/strong><br>The American omelet has a golden born crust as it is cooked on high heat. Any sort of ingredient that you like can be added, or it can be left plain. Before serving, the omelet is folded in half.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cheese Omelet<\/strong><br>Though any kind of cheese may be added, the favorites are cheeses that melt easily and become gooey centers in a nice hot omelet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Denver Omele<\/strong>t<br>According to gunthertoodys.com, \u201cDiners menus have traditionally had a strong emphasis on breakfast items. The average diner features a variety of egg-based dishes, especially omelettes. One such dish that is well-known across the country is the Denver, or Western, omelette, which contains ham, green bell peppers, onions and cheese.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>French Omelet<\/strong><br>Unlike the American omelet, the French omelet does not have ingredients, and it is not golden brown, but is cooked on lower heat so that there is no brown at all. Also, the French omelet does not have to be any particular shape. It can be folded in half or in thirds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Frittata<\/strong><br>Though it may not technically be an omelet, a frittata is similar in many ways. The main difference is that a frittata is not folded, but is started on the stovetop and finished in the oven. Also, unlike a quiche, a frittata has no crust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ham and Cheese Omelet<\/strong><br>A ham and cheese has bits of diced ham and cheese. It can be folded in half or in thirds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Spanish Omelet<\/strong><br>The Spanish omelet, or tortilla, is similar to the frittata in that it is filled with ingredients and started on the stove. Unlike the frittata, the tortilla is flipped and finished on the stove top.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As stated, omelets can be folded in half or in thirds. Most of the omelets that I prepared were folded at the ends before folding into thirds, making sort of a burrito shape. I worked with one chef who folded his omelets into a perfect square. What matters isn\u2019t the shape of the omelet but the deliciousness of the omelet that can be served, hot and fresh, at any meal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other ingredients besides ham and cheese include tomato, mushroom, onion, green onion, pancetta, green peppers, hot peppers, cooked bacon, greens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can celebrate by having an omelet any time that you like: breakfast, lunch or dinner. Just remember to not use all of your eggs.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sunday, July 9 is National Don&#8217;t Put All Your Eggs in One Omelet Day.
