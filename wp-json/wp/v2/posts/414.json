Me neither. But if you ever do, it should be a good one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joking aside, I was looking for an acronym for the word love. This is what I came up with: leftovers vs. Escoffier. But who or what, you may be asking, who is Escoffier? Well, I\u2019m glad you asked. To borrow a phrase from Bill and Ted, he was a French dude.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Wikipedia, Georges Auguste Escoffier, was born in France in the mid 1800s. He died in 1935. In between, he invented \u2014 wrote down \u2014 much of what we now know as French cuisine. Whole stores as well as a number of restaurants and just about overhang that\u2019s based on food (cooking shows, magazines and cookbooks) has it\u2019s roots in the work of Escoffier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how does that relate to love? For me, cooking is love. I\u2019d say it was something I fell into rather than something I picked; it picked me, due to a lack of other choices at the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than bore you with my culinary background, I\u2019ll tell you a story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember being told, \u201cCuriosity killed the cat.\u201d Now, I knew better, even at the age of eight. My parents taught me better. I don\u2019t know about you, but as a youth, I was forever curious. So, who told me about the inevitable death of the cat? It was she school\u2019s librarian. Go figure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, it\u2019s the car that kills the cat, at least that\u2019s my experience. The cat crosses the street because it \u2014 like many of us, wants to know the freedom of venture, and to find mice. Personally, I hate mice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever, if just by chance seen a \u201cPlayboy Magazine,\u201d or any other magazine of the same nature? At first, they were innocent pictures. But, over time, depravity demanded more and more, until the first issues wouldn\u2019t be recognizable in today\u2019s society. Like \u201cLife\u201d magazine, \u201cPlayboy\u201d is no more. These magazines could compete on the Internet, so they\u2019re gone. Instead, we have PornHub and countless other websites. And with a credit or debit card, you too can join the millions who search the Internet, looking for love. But is it love?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The short answer: no. But here\u2019s the truth: Nooooooooooooo. God offers us Escoffier, but this kind of love is the leftovers that the world offers, the kind that someone dug out of the trash. And no matter how appealing it may seem, what those looking for these things as well as those who pose for the same are both looking for the same thing: love. What they really need is the love of a father: the love of God the Father.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s free, you know. God offers his love freely and without any stipulations. What do I have to do to get this love? Just ask. God is waiting to hear from you. I\u2019m just the messenger.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the way, real love takes commitment. It\u2019s a fearful thing, and we need the help of others or partial blindness to get there.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Did you ever hear the joke about the Arkansan, the photographer and the tourist?
