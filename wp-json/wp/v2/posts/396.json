There are countless books and other materials on how to obtain and main self confidence. We want self confidence not only for ourselves, but we also hope to instill it in our children: the two and a half that we may or may not be blessed enough to have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some problems, however, with self confidence, or self esteem. The first is that some of the people with the highest self esteem are in prisons, or so I\u2019m told. It\u2019s pride that gets in the way and it\u2019s pride that causes us to do things that will harm others. It\u2019s pride that allows us to blame others for our shortcomings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another problem, as I mentioned, is that self esteem comes and goes. It often depends on our circumstances. So, when our circumstances aren\u2019t going well, we tend to get down or depressed. Depression can turn to isolation, which can lead to more depression.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, self confidence is best developed through the process of trial and error. Confidence that hasn\u2019t been tested my failure will be weak. And, depending on what you hope to do, failure can add up quickly. It can be all too easy to just give up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If, however, we put our confidence in the Lord, then our confidence will be sure. While the Bible speaks very little about self confidence, there are numerous verses on having confidence in Jesus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ \u2014 Philippians 1:6 (KJV)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do we build confidence in our children? Let them try things. Supervise, but don\u2019t do it for them. You can help by setting them up for success. If they fail, stay positive. If they succeed, celebrate with them. And, remember to celebrate when you succeed, too, even in the little things.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I got an early start this morning, making time to get a haircut, where I saw a sign that said, \u201cYou can get your hair back.\u201d I think they threw mine away after sweeping it off of the floor.
