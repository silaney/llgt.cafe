It would be great if I could say, \u201cWell, I have no control over that, so, I\u2019m just not going to worry about that.\u201d But that\u2019s not normally how it goes. Fortunately, I can look back and realize that things normally work out, one way or another, even if it\u2019s not exactly what I expected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Romans 8:31 (KJV) says, \u201cWhat shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to that, we also have this promise in Romans 8:28 (KJV): \u201cAnd we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Worry steals our joy, and does little to nothing to actually solve any problems. One possible solution would be to draw a circle in the middle of a piece of paper. At the top of the page, write a short description of what the paper is. Inside the circle, write what you can and should do to resolve the issue. Outside the circle, write the things that could happen that are outside of your control. You might be amazed how putting things in writing can help reduce stress and worry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another solution is to stop and pray. Ask God for guidance and wisdom. And pray that God will work out things so that He will be glorified.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Far too often, I spend way too much time worrying about what might happen.
