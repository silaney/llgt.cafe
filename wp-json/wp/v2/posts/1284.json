I even imagined me making an elephant but my creations never got beyond the imagination stage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got pencils, colored pencils and pencils that are watercolors. I even got a fancy coloring book, but I\u2019ve hardly used any of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got watercolors and I\u2019ve not used them at all. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t enjoy watercolors or know how to use them. I do know how to use them. It just seems that I haven\u2019t found the occasion to use them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve even picked up several art pads and notebooks. One of them has been making a handy pad for my phone. But most of the art pads sit in a stack, unused and hardly touched.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is one arts and craft item that I have been enjoying, and it is the least expensive of all: that is Play-Doh. I really like the texture and the smell. I don\u2019t have to make anything special out of it and, when I\u2019m done, I can put it right back in it\u2019s container.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, the best art supplies aren\u2019t the fanciest or the most expensive. They say that the best camera is the one that you carry around with you. And I find Play-Doh works for me. What craft or crafts do you enjoy most?
