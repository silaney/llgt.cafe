Whatever you do, you need to get ready. In the culinary world, it\u2019s called mise en place: just a fancy French way of saying \u201cget ready.\u201d It\u2019s getting the things that you need to work with, tools and supplies, as well as any mental preparation needed to complete the job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting ready requires a knowledge of what one is trying to do. And, if somehow, you come across something that has not been done before, it requires the courage to go beyond the mistakes and failures to keep trying until something works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may require trial and error, whether you are the first one to do something or it has been done countless times before, unless you take one of those jobs that really doesn\u2019t take any thought. You can just do what you are told. Even then, you must learn over time and correct any mistakes that are made. There\u2019s nothing wrong with these jobs. I have a job like this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It requires having skills and sharpening these skills. None of us can do everything and we shouldn\u2019t try. For, if we try to do everything, it is likely that we won\u2019t do any of them well. But we can hone certain skills. We can keep learning, getting better and, if necessary, changing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We must not only know what we are doing, but we must be trustworthy. And we must show ourselves trustworthy over time. It must not simply be what we are when no one else is watching, but it must be what we are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doing anything well takes time. We must start by sharpening our minds, getting ready and putting all of the parts together. We may start with dull tools and, yes, we may get the job done, but it is going to be so much harder and. It will take much more effort and take so much more work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we just take the time, before we get started, to put together the things that we need and to prepare our minds for the task at hand, we will be so much better off. We can choose. We can choose the easy way, stopping first to sharpen our tools, to sharpen our minds, or we can choose the hard way. Which will you choose?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cIf the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.\u201d \u2014 Proverbs 10:10 (KJV) It\u2019s true.
