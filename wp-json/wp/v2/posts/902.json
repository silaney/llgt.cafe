Just that sometimes, I have to go real slow.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trend has long been to do more, faster and better than before. I think we all feel the pressure in some way to get more done. Yet, even God took a day off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are at least a few ways to take a step back from our work. We just have to figure out what works best for us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plan ahead to do nothing. It could mean that you plan to set aside a few minutes each day, or it could mean that you plan to take a full day off each week. It also means figuring out what you may need to do or to put off in order to take this time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By doing nothing, I don\u2019t mean that you have to lie in bed and not move. What I\u2019m talking about may look like one of the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Take a nap.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Call a friend.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Journal.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pray or pick up a Bible.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Draw, crochet, cook or something else.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Take a leisurely walk.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are just a few ideas. The thing is that some of us \u2014 myself included \u2014 have to plan things or else they just don\u2019t happen. And, for me, even putting something on a to-do list dues\u2019t guarantee that it will get done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing is to do something that you will enjoy doing. And keep it simple. Don\u2019t think, as I some times do, my neighbor\u2019s lawn needs cleaning, so I\u2019m going to take care of that. Yes, there is a time for these things, but it cannot replace taking at least a little time to replenish ourselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can taking time off be taken to extremes? Yes, everything can. That\u2019s probably why God limited it to one day. And when God gave us 10 commandments, taking time off was just one of them \u2014 and not even the first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can keep ourselves so busy that we forget what we are doing it for. What we do, we should do out of love. Whether it\u2019s working or taking time to help someone else, cooking, drawing or helping little old ladies across the street, we should do it out of love.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, God loved us so much that He sent His one and only son to die for us so that He could restore a broken relationship between us. Yes, God had to plan ahead. He had to sacrifice something He loved. But He loved us that much.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;Jesus loves me, this I know.
