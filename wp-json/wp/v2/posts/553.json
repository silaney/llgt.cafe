After starting out as the &#8220;Oreo Biscuit,&#8221; the cookies&#8217; official name changed to the &#8220;Oreo Sandwich&#8221; in 1921, to the &#8220;Oreo Creme Sandwich&#8221; in 1948, and to the &#8220;Oreo Chocolate Sandwich&#8221; in 1974. Variations of the cookie have been introduced over the years: Double Stuf Oreos were introduced in 1975, fudge-covered Oreos in 1987, Halloween Oreos in 1991, and Christmas Oreos in 1995. Today, nine out of ten American households buy Oreos. Each year 7.5 billion cookies are purchased. As of 2015, more than 450 billion Oreos have been sold.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, if you find that you don\u2019t have any Oreos \u2014 at least in the US \u2014 you can find them at any local grocer and at many convince stores. If you prefer, you can order them from Amazon (link: <a href=\"https:\/\/amzn.to\/3ZnEeZn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/amzn.to\/3ZnEeZn<\/a>)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What do you think of as the most popular cookie?
