As we grow, and our lives become busier and busier, it can be hard to find time to expand our inner circle of friends. As tech replaces human contact, there are still ways of interacting with others in person. There are plenty ways to meet new people: here are 10 of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Join a club<\/strong><br>This could be anything from a book reading club to a motorcycle club. Search online for a local club, by using searches on Google or Facebook, or some other search engine. Certain clubs may require a minimum skill level or the ownership of required equipment (example: if you don\u2019t own a camera, you will probably want to buy one before joining a photo club, though, a smart phone may work just fine.) Club size may also be limited, and it might be important to find out when and where meetings will be held, in case there is a time or any other conflicts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Join a sports team<\/strong><br>A team differs from a club in that they tend to get together on a weekly or monthly basis, or practice or for competition. Teams might include games such as basketball, baseball, soccer, and bowling. Though not a team sport, gold is another viable option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Take a second job, or do volunteer work<\/strong><br>Get paid to meet others, or do it for free. It may be difficult to find an organization that needs your help and\/or your particular skill set, but keep looking. It took me nearly six months to find a place to volunteer in my new home. There are countless ways to find new jobs (indeed.com is just one option.) And if an online search doesn\u2019t help with finding a place to volunteer, the local chamber of commerce may be able to help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Walk at the park or mall<\/strong><br>Though it\u2019s possible to walk almost anywhere, it might be best to choose a place that has more people, such as a mall or park. These areas may not only have more people, they are also designed for walking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Visit your neighbor<\/strong><br>If you have a new neighbor, or if you are new in an area, just say hi. It may not be possible to knock on a neighbor\u2019s door; it may be more appropriate to start a conversation at the edge of your own property. If you feel comfortable knocking on your neighbor\u2019s door, you may want to bring a gift, such as something that you have baked, or something that you\u2019ve grown in your garden. Just being outside, working on a car or working in a garden may be enough to meet new people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Take a class<\/strong><br>There are several ways to find a local classes. Schools, libraries, co-ops, and specialty stores are just a few places that can offer classes. Cooking, art, gardening and bee keeping are just a few examples. And if you cannot find a class that you are interested, consider teaching one, if you can find a place to meet and a subject that your audience is interested in. It may even be possible to make some extra money.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Throw a party, or invite friends to a picnic<\/strong><br>Picnics are great ways to meet people, as are parties. Food and drinks can be provided free, for a small fee, or done potluck style. Picnics can be done at home, at a park or a beach. Parties can be held indoors or outdoors, at restaurants or in a hall. Parties, however, may require a month or more of more of planning, with at least one person being committed to planning the party. A street party, for example, may require contacting city planning in order to get permits, and rentals may be another consideration.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Play bingo<\/strong><br>There may be a local bingo club. I know if a local casino that offers bingo on weekends, and have seen gatherings at malls and shopping centers. Bingo night may be listed online or advertised on a bulletin board.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shop yard sales<\/strong><br>Yard sales can be great opportunities to meet new people. You can either set up your own yard sale or shop the sales of others. Yard sales are great because they are often more casual than grocery or big box stores. And, if you find something that you like, it\u2019s usually less expensive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Go to church or attend church functions<\/strong><br>Even a town as small as 200 people can have as many as six church, and one of them is likely to meet your spiritual needs. Though a church may not meet for anything other than a church service, or be so large that it can be difficult to meet new people, many offer smaller meeting others through small groups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bulletin boards, newspapers, and word of mouth are just a few ways of finding ideas for meeting new people. In addition, there are plenty of online resources. Find or create a website for a local club, or use Facebook, and there are also online dating sites. Most times the best way to make new friends is to just be friendly.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Meeting new people isn\u2019t always as easy as it seems, and making new friends is even more difficult.
