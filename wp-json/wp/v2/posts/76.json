We were wed on January 23, 2022. Soon after, we were told that Sandy had stage four cancer. Sandy went home to be with her Heavenly Father on March 6, 2022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, even before we were married, we had chosen a small journal and had begin writing love notes to each other. These were short notes that expressed our feelings for each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would like to encourage keep a journal. If you don\u2019t have someone you can share a journal, you can keep one for yourself. I often write about my relationship with the living God. If you are dating or are married, you may want to consider keeping a journal with that other person. If you have a child, you might keep one for him or her.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bible is God\u2019s love letter to us. It\u2019s filled with stories of people that God used and how, in the future, God will glorify his son. It tells us that \u201c\u2026God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d \u2014 John 3:16 (KJV)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBut God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)\u201d \u2014 Ephesians 2:4-5 (KJV)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>God\u2019s love is never ending because God is love (1 John 4:8) Yet, there comes a time when our opportunity to receive God\u2019s love comes to an end. \u201cSeek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near.\u201d \u2014 Isaiah 55:6<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notes are just one way you can show your love for those in your life. It\u2019s not the quality of the journal that shows how much you love someone. It\u2019s the thought that goes into the words that you pen on its pages.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cHow sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!\u201d \u2014 Psalm 119:103 (KJV) It\u2019s coming up on the eleventh anniversary of the date that I asked Sandy to marry me.
