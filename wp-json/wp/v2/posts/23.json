It\u2019s not that my first attempt failed. I needed to take time off from writing and decided not to keep my first website. I still have the posts that I wrote for the last blog, and I may share some of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I plan to change the format. Last time, I had a daily plan of what I would write about. This time, it\u2019s more open. I\u2019m using this week to introduce the new LLGT. Next week, God willing, I could be writing about any number of topics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon, I hope to have an audio version of my blog posts available for those who, like myself, prefer listening to reading. I also want to incorporate video into my work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plan is to cover many of the subjects that I\u2019m foamier with, from the arts, to travel, business faith and relationships. I also plan on covering subjects that I\u2019m not as familiar with and will require at least some research. I also hope to throw in a little humor from time to time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have questions, let me know. Perhaps, we can find an answer, together. Is there something that you want to know about, let me know. If you want to share your own story, please do. I hope that you will make LLGT yours, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>LLGT is family friendly and is not meant for just one age group. Hopefully it will be a place of open discussion and of sharing. But I will not allow comments, as I found out with my last blog, containing links that link to porn sites. LLGT should be a safe place for everyone who visits my website. God has given us a great big world to explore. I hope you\u2019ll explore it with me.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is my second attempt at LLGT.
