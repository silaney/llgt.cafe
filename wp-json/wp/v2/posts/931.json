It\u2019s a simple question, right? Last night, I got about four hours sleep. I got to bed late and woke up early. For a few, this might be enough sleep. For me, it\u2019s not. Fortunately, I did get a little more sleep after going to an appointment that I had, but it still doesn\u2019t seem like enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are less needed things that make it harder to know when enough is enough. For example, I got another lens for my camera last week. It wasn\u2019t all that expensive compared to most of the lenses that Canon sells and it fills a \u201cneed\u201d that my other lenses don\u2019t. But it\u2019s not a need, it\u2019s a want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, there is a mixer on display at Sam\u2019s Club that looks so nice. But it\u2019s not a need or a want, at least not now. And I don\u2019t have room for it in my kitchen. Really the list of things could go on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, there are things that I have in my life from time to time that I would rather not have: frustration, irritation and loneliness, just to name a few. These are just some of the things that I would rather not deal with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know that, according to the Bible, it\u2019s the latter things \u2014 the loneliness and frustrations \u2014 that draw us closer to or make us more like God? I know it, but it\u2019s easy to forget, especially when we\u2019re \u201csuffering\u201d these things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what are we to do? For the first, it\u2019s best to have a budget. It needs to be one that we can stick with, and it should be as close to our actual needs as possible. I say this because things like groceries can be hard to predict, unless we really work hard at planning both the budget and our diet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the other things, we can learn to deal with them. Breathing exercises \u2014 taking a long breath in through the nose, holding it for a few seconds and a long breath out the mouth can help. Just counting slowly to ten can also help.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see, most of our life depends on how we see it. If we see getting a parking ticket as a bad thing, it becomes a bad thing. But if we are able to see it as building patients, it can become a positive thing; that is, if we want to be more patient. For now, I think there might be enough time for another nap.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How much is enough? It\u2019s a simple question, right?
