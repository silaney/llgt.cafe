And we could all think of a few. Unfortunately, it\u2019s all too easy to miss at least some opportunities because, it seems, we are all so busy. If we\u2019re not running to the next major event, we\u2019re answering a text or checking social media. It seem \u201csafer\u201d to stay busy with social media than to risk putting ourselves out there to help others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s called \u201cCommon Courtesy\u201d because it probably was more common. There was no social media to lean on, and there probably weren\u2019t as many things that \u201chad to be done.\u201d But when we realize all that God has done for us, courtesy is something that we want to show, common or not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even in the past, common courtesy was something that had to be learned. We aren\u2019t born with this trait. In fact, when we are young, we tend to focus on our own needs. We must not only be told to be courteous, but we must see someone else be courteous. If someone tells us to be courteous and they themselves are rude, we\u2019re not likely to \u201cdo as they say.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember to show courtesy, and not only today, especially if little ones are watching. And don\u2019t just be courteous out where others can see you. Common courtesy begins in the home.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today is National Common Courtesy Day, and it is observed each year on November 21.
