Home Business Month is a crucial event to celebrate and promote home business and their owners. However, what will make the month memorable for small businesses is if it significantly impacts their sales and income.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting a month aside for home businesses is good, but we can be carried away by the event and ignore the businesses. Therefore, we must be intentional about helping businesses that are running from home in a visible and measurable way.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are wondering how to support home businesses but have no idea, these are 5 ways you can help promote and grow home businesses around you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shop Local<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step toward supporting home businesses is choosing to shop locally. The impact is more direct, visible and encouraging.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of defaulting to big-box retailers or online giants, make a conscious effort to seek out home businesses in your community. Explore online marketplaces, social media platforms, or local directories to discover a wide range of offerings.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most small businesses have great quality products and render excellent services. Patronizing them will enable you to contribute to the local economy and create a diverse retail landscape.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Explore freelancers, consultants, e-commerce, home-based food businesses, coaching, and home-based childcare to discover hidden gems and support the entrepreneurs who poured their heart and soul into their businesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spread the Word<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marketing is the life of a business; that is why big corporations invest heavily in digital and traditional marketing. However, one of the most potent forms of marketing less talked about is word-of-mouth marketing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharing positive experiences about a product or service to one&#8217;s circle of influence is more effective than coming across that same business online or in a local newspaper. So, utilize Home Business Month to convert your family and friends to customers of local businesses that served you well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will particularly help small businesses working with a small marketing budget. Your genuine support and endorsement can attract new customers and boost the visibility of small businesses, helping them thrive and grow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Engage on Social Media<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most small businesses are on social media. But getting engagements is usually challenging because of a limited social media marketing budget.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, you can drive engagement and make them more visible online by liking their posts or sharing pictures of you patronizing them. Social media endorsement is powerful and can blow up the sales of any small business that goes viral.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Popular social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Tik-Tok have created platforms for local businesses to connect with their customers. Use their hashtags and tag them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, every business is only one post away from becoming big in today&#8217;s digital world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attend Virtual Events<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Home businesses often organize virtual events like product launches, workshops, or webinars. Virtual events provide opportunities to learn more about the business, interact with the owner, and potentially make a purchase. Your attendance and active participation demonstrate support and help home businesses thrive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, freelance writers launch book pre-sale campaigns to create a buzz around their new books and increase sales even before the book launch. You can support them by purchasing their books which are mostly sold at a discounted rate, sharing campaign links on your social media pages, inviting people to the book launch, and buying a copy for a friend.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people do not take virtual events seriously because they feel it&#8217;s less impactful. But that used to be in the past. Virtual events are engaging and impactful. Thanks to advanced and simple software that makes interaction, financial transactions, and networking easy virtually.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leave Reviews<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good reviews are like magnets that attract new customers to home businesses. They are also like the lifeblood that keeps home businesses running. People are skeptical about patronizing home businesses, especially those online, because of past poor experiences, fear of being scammed, and other reasons. However, your positive review can be the prompt someone needs to give a home business a try.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media platforms, online marketplaces, and websites create sections for review. If you have an excellent experience, leave a 5-star review stating the value you got.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this Home Business Month, write a genuine review about home businesses you patronize on review platforms. These reviews serve as testimonials to attract potential customers and increase home business owners&#8217; income.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Home Business Month is not only about marking your calendar and recognizing August as a day set aside for home businesses. Instead, it&#8217;s a platform to support businesses striving beyond all odds to succeed. Therefore, patronize them, and promote them to your network and community to contribute to the diversity and vitality of your local business community.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>August is home business Month.
