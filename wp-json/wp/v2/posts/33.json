I keep it where I can easily see it. On a dry erase board, I have the word \u201cHabits\u201d written. Each time I do one of the things on my list, I put a small box. I had thought about using candies, moving them from one container to another whenever I did something on my list, but this seemed counterproductive. It\u2019s sort of like given myself a gold star.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have to admit that I had hoped that this system would work for a couple of habits that I would like to break. Sadly, it hasn&#8217;t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Clear, it\u2019s a good idea to start small. It\u2019s better to take one step, workout for three minutes, or floss one tooth until it becomes a daily routine. My list includes push-ups  (I do three of them), walking ten minutes a day \u2014 weather permitting \u2014 and writing in my journal. I have drawing on my list, but stopped that habit after a couple of days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might like to try something similar. Or, maybe you have your own system. If so, I\u2019d love to hear about it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I started something different about a week ago.
