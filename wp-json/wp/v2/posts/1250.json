If you haven\u2019t already made plans and if you still have time before school starts, there\u2019s still time to celebrate. If you don\u2019t already have plans, it would probably be a good idea to stay local, meaning, this may not be a good time to start booking flights for this weekend. Here are some ideas:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Find the closest museum. There are a few near and not so near me and some of them are free. There is at least one art museum, an air museum and the U of A has a museum that is within walking distance from where I live.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>You may be able to find a concert that you are interested in. It could be at a huge auditorium or at a local bar\/pub. Personally, I would rather hear live music at a pub. Either way, I recommend that you make sure that the music is suitable for everyone who will be going.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Go to a lake or to the ocean. This isn\u2019t really for me \u2014 not until the weather starts cooling down \u2014 but you might enjoy it. You may want to arrive early but that\u2019s up to you.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Find a movie that everyone might enjoy. Or there may be a play in your area that you might be interested in. Christian Youth Theater, CYT, and other organizations, put on plays on a regular basis. You can check your local listings.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have a game day. It could be board games, charades or something like Tic-Tac-Toe. There\u2019s also Simon Says and countless other games. Solitaire works, too.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever you decide to do, have fun. And feel free to share your story in the comments below. Thanks and have a happy Family Fun Month.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>August is Family Fun Month.
