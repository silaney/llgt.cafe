I found out some time around 8 AM. It seems that the rain caused a tree limb to droop down low enough to hit a power line.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s an easy fix for the power company. But if I hadn\u2019t seen the power company truck, I would not have known.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if the power weren\u2019t back on. What would I do if the power outage were more widespread? After a tornado hit neighboring towns a little over 2 years ago, the place where I work lost power for three days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, I have backup lights, and that\u2019s a good place to start. But that\u2019s only a start. I can\u2019t make my instant coffee and, if the power were still out, I wouldn\u2019t want to open my fridge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what is it that I need if the power goes out for an extended time \u2014 say, a week or more?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Light<br>Light comes in handy. And, if you have light, it helps to see what you are doing. Along with that is the batteries to power that light.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Water<br>Water may be next, if the water fails to run. LifeStraws are also a good source of clean water. They filter water that is not drinkable and makes it drinkable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sheler<br>Assuming that there is no structural damage, as in an earthquake or tornado, some form of protection from the heat or cold may be needed. A battery powered fan may be useful. Extra blankets can also help; sleeping bags work, too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Food<br>Canned goods may be important. Try to stick with things that you know that you will use, whether in an emergency or not. If you won\u2019t eat it before it expires, you probably shouldn\u2019t buy it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Planning<br>This includes making plans of what to do if the power goes out. You may check to see if there is still radio. If there is, great. If not, wait. Phone service may or may not work. Check the weather to see if it is raining. You may also check to see if anyone else is without power. If they have power, it\u2019s likely that the problem is in your home or apartment. If you know your neighbors, you may be able to help them with their needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Planning can help with a lot of issues in an emergency, such as a power outage. But it can\u2019t solve every issue that might arise. I find that prayer goes a long way, too. In an emergency, teamwork goes much further. It\u2019s a win-win situation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The power went out some time after 7:30 AM. I found out some time around 8 AM.
