You probably have your favorite places, too. For me, it\u2019s usually a bakery, a bookstore, a camera store, a place where I can take pictures, or even a website that I visit frequently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, one of my favorite places is a small spot on the creek that runs along the bicycle path near where I live. The creak is easy to access and the rocks in the creek help create small waterfalls.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On of my favorite places to visit in the Bible is the book of Psalms. In the Psalms, David and it\u2019s other writers not only wrote about the wonders of the living God, but they are also very open bout their own feelings and desires.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhy art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.\u201d \u2014 Psalm 43:5 (KJV)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Psalm 23, David wrote, \u201cThe Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.\u201d And though David had faced many trials, including a king that wanted to kill him, David knew that he was safe because of his God.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that LLGT becomes a place that you want to come back to: a place where we, too, can feel safe and make ourselves comfortable. I hope that LLGT becomes one of your favorite places.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wherever I\u2019ve gone, if I stay long enough, I usually find my favorite places.
