<p>August is Family Fun Month. If you haven’t already made plans and if you still have time before school starts, there’s still time to celebrate. If you don’t already have plans, it would probably be a good idea to stay local, meaning, this may not be a good time to start booking flights for this weekend. Here are some ideas:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Find the closest museum. There are a few near and not so near me and some of them are free. There is at least one art museum, an air museum and the U of A has a museum that is within walking distance from where I live.</li>



<li>You may be able to find a concert that you are interested in. It could be at a huge auditorium or at a local bar/pub. Personally, I would rather hear live music at a pub. Either way, I recommend that you make sure that the music is suitable for everyone who will be going.</li>



<li>Go to a lake or to the ocean. This isn’t really for me — not until the weather starts cooling down — but you might enjoy it. You may want to arrive early but that’s up to you.</li>



<li>Find a movie that everyone might enjoy. Or there may be a play in your area that you might be interested in. Christian Youth Theater, CYT, and other organizations, put on plays on a regular basis. You can check your local listings.</li>



<li>Have a game day. It could be board games, charades or something like Tic-Tac-Toe. There’s also Simon Says and countless other games. Solitaire works, too.</li>
</ul>



<p>Whatever you decide to do, have fun. And feel free to share your story in the comments below. Thanks and have a happy Family Fun Month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today is Perfect Family Day. So, what does that mean? Guess what, I don’t think that such a thing exists. It’s kind of like the unicorn, or Bigfoot. Maybe someone has seen it. Maybe someone has even captured a picture of it. But it seems to only exist in the minds of individuals. I’ll get back to that, later.</p>



<p>All of us are too imperfect to, as a family unit, make up a perfect family. We make mistakes, we hurt one another, we say and do things that we know deep down that we shouldn’t. We intentionally or unintentionally do things that hurt the ones that we love the most. How can we, let along a family, be perfect?</p>



<p>Look at it this way. A puzzle isn’t made of square pieces, Each one has a unique image and shape so that it will fit in a precise place. An edge piece does not go in the middle of the puzzle, nor does a piece from the middle go on the edge. Mistakes don’t make us imperfect. And, when we hurt someone we love, when we realize what we’ve done, we can apologize. And we can try to not do the same thing, again.</p>



<p>Seeing it another way, a rare steak may be perfect for me but not for you. Salad may be my perfect dinner, or it may be a burger. Your perfect dinner may be soup and a grill cheese. The thing is, we are all unique.</p>



<p>Unlike the puzzle, God can put us together in ways that don’t fit at first. He may put us a marriage with someone we feel attracted to and, later, seems not to suit us. Yet, God sees marriage as a binding contract — until death. And that doesn’t mean until one or the other feels as if she is dying.</p>



<p>Part of building a relationship is to realize that we don’t always get our way and being okay with that. Another part is having the willingness to let God shape us into the man or woman whom God wants us to be. It really is simple: love God, love others as ourselves. The hard part may be that I may not believe that God can love me. After all, I’m so imperfect. And, not realizing how much God does love me, I cannot fully love God and others.</p>



<p>Another thing is that, if I disrespect God or his creation, I cannot fully love either. Lust, envy and spreading rumors or lies can all distort our views of others and hurt our relationship with a loving God. For a relationship is built from love and love comes from the hormones? No, it comes from the heart. But so does hate and jealousy: so, watch out for these things.</p>



<p>There is evidence that the heart is part of the nervous system that can contain memories. Aside from that, there is muscle memory. Whether memories exist outside of the brain is not what matters. What matters is that love comes from every bit of our being. It comes in the warm embrace as well as the kind deed. It comes from seeing a mistake as an attempt to learn and not as something to be avoided all together.</p>



<p>So, who is it that puts me into the relationship where I find myself? I believe that God does. Who decides when it is time to move on? Again, I believe that God does. Yet, all too often, I believe that I can take that role from God and put it on myself. Maybe you have done that too. Maybe it’s not too late to recognize our mistakes and to make reconciliation: to restore relationships once lost.</p>



<p>Is there such a thing as a perfect family? From our vantage point, probably not. But I can’t see what God sees. And that is what truly matters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thanksgiving is just days away. For many, there’s shopping to do, food to be purchased, prepared and consumed. Then there begins the preparation for Christmas. It can be a busy and, perhaps, stressful time of the year. But in the hustle and bustle of Thanksgiving, it’s good to take time to slow down and remember why we are celebrating. It’s not about the food or the football, it’s about being thankful for what we have.</p>



<p>I’m sure that the pilgrims didn’t have a lot, but they were thankful for what God had provided. Those early days in what would become the United States of America must have been difficult, but these early settlers who got together, along with several native American Indians, were thankful for what God had provided.</p>



<p>First the pilgrims must have been thankful for the help that they had received from the Indian tribe, for many of those who had come to the new land may not have known how to live off of the land. And they must have been thankful what they were able to learn from the Indians.</p>



<p>The pilgrims must have been thankful for the safety that God had provided in their journey as well as their new lives in their new home. These settlers had not only survived the long journey, but they found people who were willing to help them when they arrived in a foreign land. These pilgrims also had each other.</p>



<p>Finally, these pilgrims had food. I don’t know how much food they had but it was enough that they came together to celebrate.</p>



<p>For many, the holidays can be a difficult time of the year. It may be a painful reminder of loved ones who have died. It may also be a reminder of other losses or of the things that we do not have. Yet, we can still choose to be thankful for the things that we have, and not only on Thanksgiving.<br>We can use our fingers to come up with five things that we are thankful for. On Thanksgiving day, my friends go around the table and each person tells of at least one thing that he or she is thankful for. I’m sure if we think about it, each of us can find at least one thing that we are thankful for.</p>



<p>But there is one thing that we should not forget: whatever or whomever we are thankful for, it is God who has provided. I’m not thankful to the company for the job that provides the money to buy the food to put on the table but to God who provided the job that put the food on the table. I shouldn’t be resentful for what I don’t have but thankful for the things that I do have. And, instead of being angry because of our individual differences, I should be thankful that God has created us to be unique individuals.</p>



<p>So, in this time of celebrating nears, what is it that you are most thankful for? Personally, I am thankful that God loved me enough to send his Son, Jesus, to die on the cross in order to pay my sin debt: a debt that I could never pay. And, because of this, I can have a relationship with a living and loving God who provides for all of my needs.</p>

<p>What would your rather have?</p>



<p>A million dollars?<br>Free food for life?</p>



<p>A trip to Hawaii?<br>A trip to the country?</p>



<p>A free pass to any more for the rest of your life?<br>The ability to read any book in seconds?</p>



<p>A new car every year for the rest of your life?<br>A car that never needed repairs?</p>



<p>A personal chef for life?<br>A personal trainer for life?<br>The man or woman of your dreams?<br>To be the man or woman of someone else’s dreams?</p>



<p>A relationship with someone whom you think the be the most beautiful or most handsome?<br>A relationship of service and commitment to the other?</p>



<p>You might think that the last one is a trick question, but true, lasting relationships, thought they may begin with physical attraction, won’t last long if that’s all there is. That’s why so many relationships don’t last. A lasting relationship needs a commitment to the other person that goes deeper and seeks to serve and love the other.</p>



<p>“Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.” — 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 (NIV)</p>



<p>There’s nothing in that verse that talks about getting our own way or having things be perfect. In fact, if we keep looking for perfection, we will never find it. But if we seek to serve, whether it be others, or the God who created us, we will become more loving. And, as 1 Corinthians tells us, there is nothing is more important that we can do than love others.</p>

<p>If you want to spend time with your friends, and are looking for an excuse to get together, these ideas just may help.</p>



<p>Find a movie that you can watch together. If you like, you can bring the TV outside and watch it in the great outdoors. Rent one of the new releases or find an old classic. Make popcorn or other snacks, and have drinks available.</p>



<p>Maybe you can find some place to go hiking. A long walk and fresh air just may be what you and your friend needs. Bring a camera and/or binoculars and, if you like, you can bring along a bird book or look for other things, like plants or mushrooms.</p>



<p>If crafting is your thing, maybe you can find something to make with your friends. You can use just about anything that you want, from wood to wax, paper to paint. Just about anything that you imagine you can make.</p>



<p>You could also cook something together. You could bake or barbecue, you could go shopping for the ingredients or catch them at a nearby lake or river. You could have an old fashion ice cream social, or tea for two.</p>



<p>Maybe you would rather go for a bicycle ride. You could go for a long or short ride. If you don’t have your own bicycle, some bicycle shops offer rentals that you can get by the hour or by the day.</p>



<p>Perhaps you would rather get together to read one of your favorite books. You can take turns reading, and talking about what you have read. This is something that you can do once, or you can get together on a weekly or monthly basis.<br>If you are musically inclined, maybe you can get together to form a band. This doesn’t mean that you have to record an album or go on tour, but you might be able to preform before a small crowd.</p>



<p>If you have some ideas of your own, please share them. We would be glad to hear our ideas.</p>

<p>What is the best gift that you can give your friends or family? It’s not something that you can buy, and it’s not something that you can wrap up in a box. The best gift that you can give to anyone is your time.</p>



<p>But there is more to it than just being present. You should also be fully engaged with the other person. You shouldn’t be updating your Instagram account, or playing video games (unless you are both playing), and you shouldn’t be hiding behind a newspaper.</p>



<p>Being present means actually listening to the other person, and even responding to that person when it is appropriate: not interrupting, but acknowledging that you are listening to what the other person is trying to say.</p>



<p>It may mean scheduling time, or making adjustments to your life so that you have time to spend with friends or family. Free time may be scarce, and when it does come along, spending time with others may not be the first thing that comes to mind. Instead, we may find it easier to just spend that time alone.</p>



<p>Finally, we should try to keep ourselves healthy. We may have limited control over how long we will live, but we can at least try to stay healthy. Exercise, proper diet, along with regular physical exams can go a long way in keeping us alive longer.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that we still need to respect the time of others. Time is something that we often take for granted, but it truly is the best gift that you can give to anyone. Also, remember that time is the best gift that someone else can give to you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We call it social media, but does it really help our social life? I saw a post on Facebook that said that our phones were keeping us closer to those who are far away but far from those who are close.</p>



<p>Social media isn’t really to blame for keeping those who are physically close at bay and more than the candy at the store makes me buy it. Social media is, however, designed to be easy to use, as is the candy at the store placed in a way that it is easily found.</p>



<p>Yes, social media can be a way in which we can keep in touch with family and friends who are far away. And as much as we move from place to place, it can be good to stay in touch with those we care about.</p>



<p>One problem with social media is that it allows us to put on sort of a mask that can hide reality. We don’t need social media to do this, but it can make it easier. The truth is that our lives aren’t always exciting — I know that mine isn’t — and our lives don’t always turn out the way that we might have wanted. And it can be easy to paint a false image of how well things are going — on social media or otherwise.</p>



<p>Social media tends to be one dimensional, as well, and lacks the true depth of real life. Sure, real life can be can be complicated, but that doesn’t make it bad. And easy isn’t always the best way.</p>



<p>The best way is to be open and real in our relationships. It might be hard, but it may be worth it. Ideally, one place that we ought to be the most welcome is the church. Unfortunately, all too often, this can sometimes can sometimes be one the hardest places to be open about our struggles.</p>



<p>There is a bright side to social media. With many unable to go to church, many churches have taken to the internet and are at least in part meeting online. It may not be the same as meeting in person, but the truth of God’s word may be reaching more people.</p>



<p>It may be a good idea to take a holiday from our electronics now and then. It’s hard to find group of people together where they aren’t all looking at their phones. I think that our phones and other devices have caused us to forget what it really means to be social.</p>



<p>Don’t be afraid to say hi to others. If you have time, you might even be able to ask someone else how she is doing. The problem is, though, that we are all too busy, and much of this business is due to the time we spend on social media</p>

<p><strong>&#8221; To describe my mother would be to write about a hurricane in its perfect power. Or the climbing, falling colors of a rainbow.&#8221;<br>-Maya Angelou</strong><br>I have always sought the meaning of love. Trying hard to see how much of it exists in this world we live in, but most times, all I have to do is look at my mother. I behold her, and my eyes sting from the emotions I try so hard to restrain. She is the epitome of true love.<br>Sometimes, it breaks my heart when I think of how I have done so little… not enough to show my gratitude for all the things she&#8217;s done for me.It&#8217;s not like she is plagued with entitlement to bother about returns, it is just the way she is.</p>



<p><br>As I through my thoughts, my sight is brightened with colors: colors that paint beautiful pictures of the love, warmth, and care I have received from my mother.</p>



<p><br>Patient, caring and kind are cliches used to describe a good person, and so I remember this particular day, years ago when I was so small and naive. I had just finished my exams in pre-school and my results were given to me. I was overwhelmed with joy as I thought about the little booklet in my hands. The teacher had said, &#8220;give this to your mother when you get home.&#8221; And I couldn&#8217;t wait to deliver the message. Finally! Something, -a gift I thought- to give my parents.</p>



<p><br>I can&#8217;t remember what took place, but according to my mother, I approached her almost breathlessly to hand over my results. My eyes were bright and full of delight. She hurriedly opened the booklet. My excitement had affected her, and she was as eager as I was.</p>



<p><br>What she saw was heartbreaking. I had performed poorly in class, so poorly, I came second from the last. She stared at my pretty face and saw a bright smile. At that point, she realized I had no clue about what was going on. Overcome with emotions she broke down in tears. Not because she was angry or offended, but because she was moved by my innocence. At that point, I also blurted out in tears, I was confused as my little brain then could not understand why my mum would cry. I hated to see her sad.<br>Funnily anytime she tells that story, I fight down the surging emotions that overwhelm me. And that story always reveals something deep to me about motherhood.</p>



<p><br>You see, my mom has always been a smart kid. Always took the first position, and always got the prize for best student in her class. She used to say, everybody would call her name even before the result was announced. They would call, sing and praise her. She did well throughout secondary school, but couldn&#8217;t go to the university because of the lack of funds and support. She went on to work so she could cater to her siblings and parents. She has always carried the burden of her family on herself.<br>She worked hard to earn enough to sponsor her siblings to school due to her zeal and passion to help them become the best for themselves, and for society at large. The life of my mother has taught me so much that I would like to talk about.</p>



<p><br>Firstly, she is patient in every sense of the word. Life has been fair because she cares. It always amazes me the way she tends to others more than they do to themselves. She has nurtured and protected the life of the people around her from the harshness of society.</p>



<p><br>I realize that when the heat pours, and my heart is torn, her arms are where I find the comfort I need. Her soothing words have always been the ointment I need to heal. Whenever I go through tough times, I remember her words, &#8220;you can do this,&#8221; &#8220;you are capable of soaring above your limitations,&#8221; and &#8220;The world is waiting for your light.&#8221;</p>



<p><br>She has always spoken positive words to me, and It is at these times, in these moments that I carry on, with the boldness and tenacity of a world champion. It is these words that make me surprise myself with my capabilities &#8211; My superpowers that would otherwise be hidden inside me.<br>I have always been a shy child. Unable to speak up when I should, but her life has taught me the way of the Lord. She trained me to walk on the right path, and this has changed my life forever. It has given me boldness and has made me learn about myself.</p>



<p><br>Secondly, she is kind. I know this not because of how she treats me, but how she relates with everyone in her world. I have seen her bleed for others to feed. I have seen her fast while others get indulge. And even when I am infuriated by her self- sacrificing nature, it is the way she smiles and tells me, &#8220;all will be well,&#8221; That always transforms my anger to wonder at her. To marvel at her tender heart.<br>I love how she mixes such tenderness with zeal and dogma. She will spare no time, and no treasure so those around her can transform into precious jewels. I see her and I check myself, I see her and I adjust my life. As a child, I also remember how she stood for us during the times Dad traveled on long trips. She was our stability. She prayed for us and taught us to pray for ourselves. This also has saved me from terrorizing situations.</p>



<p><br>I have often looked at myself and realized I would have been lazy. But she served as a good example through her relentless effort in all that she did. She moved against all odds to improve herself, to make her life better. I saw this and it made me venture into a business while at school. It gave me the courage to mix and handle two different degrees and my business at the same time. True, it was strenuous and difficult, but I lacked the fear to stop. Her life encouraged me to move on. I saw how she mixed her work, with your school, function in the church, and the ever-demanding role of wife and mother.<br>I also love the way she loves my Father. I see how she sticks with him through the difficult and the easy times. Through the rain and sunshine. I see how she loved him unconditionally and supported him passionately, and tenderly. Her life teaches me faithfulness because I&#8217;m learning how to be a loving and supportive wife to my husband when the time comes.</p>



<p><br>I am grateful to God for her life, and I&#8217;m grateful to her for being such an inspiration. I am thankful to her for being a helper. I Thank her for being a teacher, a supporter, my cheerleader, and my first audience. Thank you Mom for believing in me and for fighting for me. Thank you for loving me. You have set a yardstick in my life and I&#8217;m not confused when I see true love. Thank you for being a good mother to me. I love you.</p>
