										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dear Diary,</p>



<p>Morning came too early. Bunnies were out. Squirrels came out later. There was a grey crown night heron near the hospital: just visiting, probably.</p>



<p>It took me about half an hour to make it to the store. When I was close, I heard some homeless guy saying something that doesn’t need to be repeated. Ever.</p>



<p>I decided to take my own advice and picked up a planner, mainly for the purpose of menu planning. It goes from April 2024 though the end of 2025. The other day, I was cleaning up and threw away a 2023 planner that went unused, so I hope that this one actually gets used for what it is intended for.</p>



<p>I got more Play-Doh, because I like it. It’s so much fun to squish and make things with. Unlike Lego, it just has one piece. It seems to just come in four colors.</p>



<p>Yesterday, I joined a local gym. I need to decide when I should go and actually exercise instead of just asking about the membership. This morning, I walked about a mile and a half, then I took the bus back. That counts for something.</p>



<p>I bought another song for my collection: Josh Baldwin’s “Made For More.” I heard it on the radio and decided to buy it. It seems that I got the live version. I like it.</p>



<p>It’s supposed to rain tomorrow. Maybe the rain will bring cooler temperatures.</p>



<p>Now might be a good time to go to the library. Maybe not, I need to go somewhere, in the opposite direction in about half an hour. I thought I was arriving on time last week and it turned out that I was a week early. Who knew. I didn’t.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>“How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!” — Psalm 119:103 (KJV)</p>



<p>It’s coming up on the eleventh anniversary of the date that I asked Sandy to marry me. We were wed on January 23, 2022. Soon after, we were told that Sandy had stage four cancer. Sandy went home to be with her Heavenly Father on March 6, 2022.</p>



<p>Yet, even before we were married, we had chosen a small journal and had begin writing love notes to each other. These were short notes that expressed our feelings for each other.</p>



<p>I would like to encourage keep a journal. If you don’t have someone you can share a journal, you can keep one for yourself. I often write about my relationship with the living God. If you are dating or are married, you may want to consider keeping a journal with that other person. If you have a child, you might keep one for him or her.</p>



<p>The Bible is God’s love letter to us. It’s filled with stories of people that God used and how, in the future, God will glorify his son. It tells us that “…God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” — John 3:16 (KJV)</p>



<p>“But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)” — Ephesians 2:4-5 (KJV)</p>



<p>God’s love is never ending because God is love (1 John 4:8) Yet, there comes a time when our opportunity to receive God’s love comes to an end. “Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near.” — Isaiah 55:6</p>



<p>Notes are just one way you can show your love for those in your life. It’s not the quality of the journal that shows how much you love someone. It’s the thought that goes into the words that you pen on its pages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There are several things that I was not fortunate to learn as a child, and one of them was the meaning of the two letter word: “No.” And, admittedly, I’m still learning. But I’ve learned over the years how important this little word is to all aspects of life.</p>



<p>I think that I first leaned the meaning of “no” after when after the death of my wife (we were married an entire seven weeks before she died of cancer). Her stream of income ended, while the bills continued to roll in. Then the creditors began to write, and they weren’t love letters. It’s strange what super powers that tragedy will give you and, for me, the ability to say no was mine.</p>



<p>The ability to say no, not only to other but to ourselves, is a powerful tool in the life of an entrepreneur. That is because saying “no” to even the good things frees us up say “yes” to the best things. But it’s not an easy choice to make, and I had to learn the hard way.</p>



<p>It’a a lesson that I’m still learning to put into practice: at lest saying “no” to myself, especially to myself. But I’m working on it. I could blame the ease of credit cards, or marketing and advertising that seems to fill nearly every moment of our waking lives. Yet, I’m the one who must ultimately has to take responsibility of my choices, and no one else.</p>



<p>Yes, it’s hard lesson to learn, but it’s really never to late. And it’s never too late to change, as long as you believe that you can.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I started something different about a week ago. I was listening to “Atomic Habits” by James Clear and decided that I wanted to work on some of my own habits.</p>



<p>On an index card, I wrote down a list of things that I would like to start doing on a daily basis. I keep it where I can easily see it. On a dry erase board, I have the word “Habits” written. Each time I do one of the things on my list, I put a small box. I had thought about using candies, moving them from one container to another whenever I did something on my list, but this seemed counterproductive. It’s sort of like given myself a gold star.</p>



<p>I have to admit that I had hoped that this system would work for a couple of habits that I would like to break. Sadly, it hasn&#8217;t.</p>



<p>According to Clear, it’s a good idea to start small. It’s better to take one step, workout for three minutes, or floss one tooth until it becomes a daily routine. My list includes push-ups  (I do three of them), walking ten minutes a day — weather permitting — and writing in my journal. I have drawing on my list, but stopped that habit after a couple of days.</p>



<p>You might like to try something similar. Or, maybe you have your own system. If so, I’d love to hear about it.</p>

<p>I do have a couple of rules.</p>



<p>Rule #1: be kind. Kindness will go a long way.</p>



<p>Rule #2: keep it clean. This is a family oriented website. No comments with links to porn or casinos or anything that is not suited for little children.</p>



<p>That’s it. Just remember to laugh, learn and keep growing. And make sure you find someone to share your story with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Hi, my name is Ralph, and I’m owner of LLGT. I would like to tell you a little about myself. I was born in Fayetteville, Arkansas — the youngest of five — the same place I now call home.</p>



<p>So much has happened over the past fifty-six plus years. So much has changed. Fayetteville has gone from from less than twenty thousand people to having a population of nearly 100,000. Much of what I remember, growing up, no longer exists.</p>



<p>No doubt the most important event in my life came when, at the age of 14, I was introduced to the Lord Jesus. At the time, all I really knew about was the baby Jesus, and he fit in there somewhere with Santa. It was then that I learned that I was a sinner (which seemed pretty obvious) but that God had sent his son to die for my sins.</p>



<p>“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” — John 3:16 (KJV)</p>



<p>In the more than 42 years since then, I’ve had the opportunity to see the many, many different beliefs that others have and, though my faith is still being shaped, I believe that my eternity is secured.</p>



<p>In my lifetime, I have wanted to be many things, from a cartoonist to an inventor, a writer, a photojournalist, an entrepreneur and much more. So far, I’ve been a photographer (part time and mostly ammeter), a cook, a writer, a sales associate and, most recently, assembler and manufacturer.</p>



<p>God has allowed me to travel parts of this world and to photograph wherever I have been. But more important than the pictures that I’ve taken are the people that I’ve met along the way, and the friendships that I’ve built.</p>



<p>When we surrender our lives to God, when he becomes part of our lives and his Holy Spirit indwells us, he changes us. We are brought from death to life, our relationship with the living God is restored, and God restores our sight.<br>.<br>“One thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.” — John 9:25</p>



<p>Over the years, I have faced many of life’s hardships with the Lord a my side. My mother died in 1987. My wife, Sandy, died in March 2012, of cancer, after less than seven weeks of marriage. And parts of my life have been more stressful than it seemed I could bear. But Jesus has always been by my side.</p>



<p>I’m still learning and still growing as a person and in my faith in Jesus. I still have a long way to go. I don’t know exactly what my future hold, but I know who holds my future. For now, I live one day at a time, and I look for every opportunity to love and serve others. When I look at my own life, I see so many imperfections. But I believe that, when God sees me, what he has is the same love that he has for his own son.</p>

<p>This is my second attempt at LLGT. It’s not that my first attempt failed. I needed to take time off from writing and decided not to keep my first website. I still have the posts that I wrote for the last blog, and I may share some of them.</p>



<p>I plan to change the format. Last time, I had a daily plan of what I would write about. This time, it’s more open. I’m using this week to introduce the new LLGT. Next week, God willing, I could be writing about any number of topics.</p>



<p>Soon, I hope to have an audio version of my blog posts available for those who, like myself, prefer listening to reading. I also want to incorporate video into my work.</p>



<p>The plan is to cover many of the subjects that I’m foamier with, from the arts, to travel, business faith and relationships. I also plan on covering subjects that I’m not as familiar with and will require at least some research. I also hope to throw in a little humor from time to time.</p>



<p>If you have questions, let me know. Perhaps, we can find an answer, together. Is there something that you want to know about, let me know. If you want to share your own story, please do. I hope that you will make LLGT yours, too.</p>



<p>LLGT is family friendly and is not meant for just one age group. Hopefully it will be a place of open discussion and of sharing. But I will not allow comments, as I found out with my last blog, containing links that link to porn sites. LLGT should be a safe place for everyone who visits my website. God has given us a great big world to explore. I hope you’ll explore it with me.</p>

<p>Wherever I’ve gone, if I stay long enough, I usually find my favorite places. You probably have your favorite places, too. For me, it’s usually a bakery, a bookstore, a camera store, a place where I can take pictures, or even a website that I visit frequently.</p>



<p>Currently, one of my favorite places is a small spot on the creek that runs along the bicycle path near where I live. The creak is easy to access and the rocks in the creek help create small waterfalls.</p>



<p>On of my favorite places to visit in the Bible is the book of Psalms. In the Psalms, David and it’s other writers not only wrote about the wonders of the living God, but they are also very open bout their own feelings and desires.</p>



<p>“Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.” — Psalm 43:5 (KJV)</p>



<p>In Psalm 23, David wrote, “The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.” And though David had faced many trials, including a king that wanted to kill him, David knew that he was safe because of his God.</p>



<p>I hope that LLGT becomes a place that you want to come back to: a place where we, too, can feel safe and make ourselves comfortable. I hope that LLGT becomes one of your favorite places.</p>

<p>Oh, hi. Welcome. Thanks for stopping by. I’m the owner, chef, barista, waiter and chief bottle washer of LLGT Cafe. Have a seat and I will tell you about my cafe.</p>



<p>LLGT stands for Laugh, Learn and Grow, to the Power of Together. It welcomes everyone. You don’t have to agree with me, but I do expect my customers to respect on another. You con’t have to agree. Just be open to other people’s opinions.</p>



<p>Laugh: Why is it that children can laugh so much when adults (like myself) find it so difficult to find the humor in things? Perhaps we become too serious.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code> “A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.”  
                            — Proverbs 17:22 KJV</code></pre>



<p>Learn: I believe that everyone that we come across in life has something to teach us. Likewise, every situation that we find ourselves in has the power to teach us something about ourselves, the world around us, and the God who created both.</p>



<p>Grow: My parents taught me that if something is not growing, it is dying. So, I want to keep growing. As a person grows, his cells divide on a cellular level. Her mind and body change over time. What is true today may not be true tomorrow. Like the shifting sand, life is continually changing in one way or another.</p>



<p>Together: Over the years, I have learned the power of working with others in doing various jobs. Yes, one person can often do a job, alone. But two people can often do greater things than one, alone. There is no collaboration without at least two people. Besides, one person can catch the mistakes of another; the more experienced can teach the newcomer.</p>



<p>My hope is that you will find LLGT Cafe a welcoming place to come every day. I can’t do this alone. Together we can grow. Together, we can learn. And, perhaps, we can find things to laugh about along the way.</p>



<p>When you come back, bring a friend with you. When you have time, I would love to hear your story.</p>
