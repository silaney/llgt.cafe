<p>Today is National Personal Chef Day</p>



<p>This is exciting. Whether you currently have a personal chef or you can barely afford your next meal, this day is for you.</p>



<p>No, really. Having a personal chef may be a great idea and, if you are thinking about hiring one, the prices may be better than you thought. If another PBJ sandwich seems on the horizon, this information could help.</p>



<p>If you want the services of a personal chef, these tips could help.</p>



<p>Figure out a budget. Is your food budget $10, $100, or $1,000? It’s important to know. And, if need be, you can use cash.</p>



<p>Collecting coupons may help reduce the cost of groceries. I find basic ingredients — eggs, flour, milk and such — work best. Add a few ingredients, and there are so many things that you can make.</p>



<p>Plan your meals, based on simple recipes. The simpler the foods, the more likely you are to stick to the plan. Some things, like a dry pancake mix, can be made up ahead of time. A planner may come in handy, where you can plan a shopping day as well as menu options.</p>



<p>Note: it’s better to have extra options instead of having too few and having to go back to the store to buy one or two items (snacks).</p>



<p>Here are some options:<br>Oatmeal<br>Ground beef<br>Burger Buns<br>Carrots (cooked or uncooked)<br>Noodles<br>Soups<br>Mixed Greens</p>



<p>These are just a few things that you can buy. The thing to remember is to buy according to the menu plan and to the budget. Keep in mind that food often costs more than we expect. It may be better to overestimate the cost of food.</p>



<p>One helpful purchase might be containers. You can portion out food and place it in storage: the pantry, fridge or freezer. If you like, you can either label these containers with “Use By” dates, the name of the item, or the date and meal that you intend to use it. Some things freeze well, while others don’t. Some things, like mixed greens, may need to be made into a salad at the last minute.</p>



<p>So many recipes are available online. If you are in the mood for chicken, see if you can buy chicken in bulk, even if you have to portion it out and freeze it. Just don’t do as I did once and leave it out overnight. Oops.</p>



<p>Keep a running list of groceries and, remember, you don’t have to buy everything on the list: just what you absolutely need and can afford. Soup may mean canned, or fresh ingredients for the same.</p>



<p>These tips from a person chef wanna-be are free and could save you a lot of money. Of course, you can also go out to eat. Restaurants these days are struggling. Just don’t make it your job to keep them in business.</p>



<p>Let me know your ideas. Thanks, in advance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Do you want some good news? I think it’s good, tough you are welcome to disagree.</p>



<p>Deuteronomy 23: 35-36 (KJV) says, “To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste. For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.”</p>



<p>You know what this means? For me, it means I don’t need to judge others or worry about doing so. And, really, I have desire to judge others. It’s too hard to tell who is telling the truth and who is lying. It’s too hard to tell the motives for any given acton. It’s nearly impossible to walk in someone else’s shoes.</p>



<p>No, I don’t know way I do many of the things that I do. So how can I expect myself to be able to understand why others do the things that they do? Answer: I cannot.</p>



<p>Say, for example, I have two children. Say that the two get into a fight and, when confronted, each blames the other. It would be a mistake to choose one over the other, but that is the tendency. Instead, both should be equally punished. Right?</p>



<p>Perhaps, or perhaps not. Maybe the best thing to do would be to help the two to find a way to work it out: to mediate a deal between the two. Far above what punishment could do, this could be a true life lesson.</p>



<p>I don’t know about you, but I am all too quick to judge other’s motives or intent. And, when I do, it can have lasting and negative effects on me and on my relationships.</p>



<p>There is, however, one thing that we can do. We can be open with each other. If something bothers us, we can say, this thing that you are doing makes me uncomfortable. It hurts me when you…..</p>



<p>We should avoid saying things like, “You are a bad person,” and “I don’t like you.” These are things that probably aren’t true, or may be true for a short time. Really, “I don’t like you” is just a way of saying “I’m mad, or sad, or both.”</p>



<p>Instead of judging, I can listen. I can ask questions and try to figure out what went wrong. I can also offer possible solutions. If a fix to the problem is found, great. If not, it may take more time. If no solution is found, maybe one person or the other just don’t want to admit that he or she may be wrong. But, again, it’s not possible for me to know with 100% certainty. Only God knows, and only God can judge the heart.</p>



<p>“Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, ‘Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord’” — Romans 12:19 (KJV)</p>



<p>What do I take away from this? I can and should be more patient — with myself and with others. I don’t need to judge others or their motives. I don’t even really need to judge my own motives. Now, if I need help with a matter, I should find out the best person to talk to. If I need medical advise, I should talk to a doctor. If I need to know how to spell a work, I find that Google works well. If I’m part of a fight, I should realize that I am part of the problem. And when I come to this realization, I should stop, step back and ask, “What is the real problem?”</p>



<p>What do you think? I think that this is good news. But you are welcome to disagree.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today is Collector Car Appreciation Day. Try saying that three times fast.<br>It’s not just about old or fancy and unique cars. A while industry has been built around the automobile. Globally, revenue from just the sale of cars, themselves, was about $31.5 billon, with a growth rate of about 8%. That’s a lot of money and outdoes most stocks on the US Stock Exchange.</p>



<p><br>Aside from the cars, there is petrol, oil changes, car washes, hotel stays, advertising fees, photographers and models. It all adds up, and this money goes out to local businesses.<br>My dream car is a Mercedes, convertible from the early 1980s. I will probably never own one, but it’s nice to dream. It would likely be deep blue with brown leather seats.</p>



<p><br>What is your dream car?</p>



<p>For me, it’s more than a dream of having a particular car. I’m more than happy with the car that I have: a 2017 gray Jeep. I’m even happier that I’m no longer driving a 1991 van: ugly in every way.<br>For me, the Jeep reminds me that things can get better, no matter how I may feel at the moment. It’s also a reminder that my God is my source and my provider. And, because of this, I don’t have to worry about tomorrow.</p>



<p>If I begin to worry, as I am prone to do from time to time, I can go from 0 to panicked in .60 seconds. But, if I keep my eyes on God, and His Word in my heart (mind), there is really nothing to fear.</p>



<p><br>How can we celebrate Collector Car Appreciation Day? It may depend on where you live. If, for example, you live in a rural community, it may be that you or your neighbor has one of these in his or her yard. You may be able find a collector car at a local car dealership. You can also find photos and posters online. And there are car magazines. Finally, there are toy, model and remote control cars.<br></p>



<p>Perhaps, just learning something new is what matters. Personally, I would say that hope is what matters. And, it matters where we put on hope. My hope is in God: the Father, Son and Holly Spirit. Where do you find your hope?</p>

<p>It can be a good thing to have a routine. And it’s likely that our routine will change several times throughout our lifetimes. But there are times when we can feel stuck in a rut. I know that this is true for me.</p>



<p>So, what do we do when when we feel like our lives are stuck — playing the same thing over and over like a broken record? Perhaps, it’s time to try something new. It doesn’t have to be anything big.</p>



<p>For me, deciding to write was something new. Yes, I had written before, keeping journals and doing other writing. I had tried to do a podcast but quickly lost interest. It just didn’t seem like it was for me. Yet, I could write and I’ve really enjoyed it.</p>



<p>If you can, try to include others. But realize that others may or may not be interested in new pursuits. That’s okay. They just may be headed in other directions or maybe they just need to remain where they are.</p>



<p>You can try varying forms of art: photography, drawing, painting, writing and even cooking are some examples of things that you may enjoy. Photography and writing are two of my favorites. And I love eating.</p>



<p>You may even take classes or find a group of people who are doing the same thing. It can be good to have others encourage you along the way. And, if you cannot find a local group, you can likely find others online.</p>



<p>If you do feel like your in a rut, maybe it’s time to try something new. You don’t have to change your whole life. Maybe you just need to make one change. The good news is that you can start today.</p>

<p>I find that I never really get everything that I want. Getting what I want is an endless persist. Now, I have everything that I need: family, a few friends, food and shelter to name a few. But there’s always some camera equipment or the latest computer that I’d like to have.</p>



<p>Statistics show that more money only makes a person happier to a certain point and once that financial plato is reached, it doesn’t add any more happiness.</p>



<p>As a believer in Christ, I find my joy in Him. There is also, as the Bible says, a peace that passes understanding. The weight of the world can weight heavy, but Jesus promised that He has overcome the world.</p>



<p>There are certainly things that I don’t want: minor irritations. Yet, I realize that there are others who have things much worse than I do.</p>



<p>I find that the best thing is to just be content with what I have. In the end, the Bible tells me that even the things that seem to bother me, God can use them to produce in me the patients that lead to endurance. No, I never will have all of the things that I want. That list is just too long. But I can choose joy. I can be thankful for what I have, in spite of what I don’t. And I can choose to trust God with the rest of it.</p>

<p>Comparison really isn’t a good thing, unless you are comparing yourself to what you used to be like. And hopefully, you can see an improvement that has taken place over time.</p>



<p>The biggest change in my life happened when I put my faith in Jesus and asked Him into my life. I was just 14 at the time but I knew that I needed God to come into my life to begin making changes. Some things changed right away, while other changes have taken more time.</p>



<p>My most recent job required a lot of changes. I had been in food service for most of my career but found myself in manufacturing. I’ve been in my new job just over two years now and I can look back at all of the lessons that I’ve learned along the way.</p>



<p>I can look at my photography and, thought I thought I was pretty good to begin with, my skill level has come closer to what I thought it was at when I started.</p>



<p>My typing ability has greatly improved since I first began typing, but my hand writing isn’t as good. My skills as an artist have also declined with lack of practice.</p>



<p>We can track some of our progress by keeping a journal or a scrapbook. Some progress is harder to keep track of. And some times it seems that I’m moving backwards when, in reality, it’s probably my target is moving further down the road. It’s pretty common that, as we get better at something, our goal also shifts.</p>



<p>If you’re just starting something, you may want to keep a journal or a scrapbook. If you’re wanting to paint or draw, try to keep your first picture so you can compare it with your most recent work. Hopefully, you can see an improvement. And try to avoid comparing yourself with others.</p>

<p>The things that I do today, the things that I do every day, especially the things that I do first thing in the morning are key to determining my future. What I do really does matter. Today, I plant the seeds that I will reap in the tomorrows to come. So, what is it that I do, or at least try to do first thing in the morning?</p>



<p>First, I read a bible verse. Psalm 143: 8 (KJV) says, “Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.”</p>



<p>I drink water, or lemon water, which helps refresh the bodies fluids.</p>



<p>I take vitamin D or a multi vitamin which can help mood in addition to having other health benefits.</p>



<p>I also listen to music. Right now, I’m listening to Audrey Assad. It’s calming and helps me to remember what really matters — a relationship with the living God.</p>



<p>Finally, I remember what I am thankful for: past, present and things to come.</p>



<p>This is what I do first thing. I also write, go for a walk and often take pictures. What is it that you could do first thing in the morning to help you get off to a good start? If you like, you can comment below.</p>

<p>They say that, in life, it’s not how you start out but how you finish that matters. But when it comes to our financial life, how we start out can be a much greater indicator of how we will finish.</p>



<p>Yes, it’s true that Sam Walton was 44 when he started Walmart, but he had already built the foundation for his work when he started. And when he did start, he was very careful how he spent each and every dollar.</p>



<p>Far too many of us grown up without the appreciation of, and the understanding of money and how it works. Instead of being encouraged to save, we are encouraged to spend, even if we are bogged down with debt. And far too often, we find excuses, or blame someone else for our own financial decisions.</p>



<p>Now, we cannot yet travel back in time, so the best place to start is now, and the best way to start is with what we have. But we can’t stope there. Like taking a long trip, we need to know where we want to go and how to get there. It’s not going to be a quick flight but a long journey. And no one is going to be able to do it for you.</p>



<p>It may be a good idea at this time to enlist the help of a financial planner. Like a travel planner, he or she can help you figure out where you want to go, and the things that you can do to get there.</p>



<p>You also need to educate yourself. Dave Ramsey and Crown Financial Ministries are two excellent places to start.</p>



<p>You will need to become clear on your financial goals because a lack of clarity will slow progress and make it harder to go anywhere. In fact, you may wind up going backwards. And the further behind you start, the harder the trip is going to be. You can keep putting it off, but it is just going to keep getting harder to reach any sort of a goal.</p>



<p>You may have to start small, but a small start is better than nothing at all. Remember to reward yourself along the way, with a pat on the back or a small cheer. And don’t think of the time it will take, but remember the goal. The time will pass whether you make progress or not.</p>

<p>If you want to spend time with your friends, and are looking for an excuse to get together, these ideas just may help.</p>



<p>Find a movie that you can watch together. If you like, you can bring the TV outside and watch it in the great outdoors. Rent one of the new releases or find an old classic. Make popcorn or other snacks, and have drinks available.</p>



<p>Maybe you can find some place to go hiking. A long walk and fresh air just may be what you and your friend needs. Bring a camera and/or binoculars and, if you like, you can bring along a bird book or look for other things, like plants or mushrooms.</p>



<p>If crafting is your thing, maybe you can find something to make with your friends. You can use just about anything that you want, from wood to wax, paper to paint. Just about anything that you imagine you can make.</p>



<p>You could also cook something together. You could bake or barbecue, you could go shopping for the ingredients or catch them at a nearby lake or river. You could have an old fashion ice cream social, or tea for two.</p>



<p>Maybe you would rather go for a bicycle ride. You could go for a long or short ride. If you don’t have your own bicycle, some bicycle shops offer rentals that you can get by the hour or by the day.</p>



<p>Perhaps you would rather get together to read one of your favorite books. You can take turns reading, and talking about what you have read. This is something that you can do once, or you can get together on a weekly or monthly basis.<br>If you are musically inclined, maybe you can get together to form a band. This doesn’t mean that you have to record an album or go on tour, but you might be able to preform before a small crowd.</p>



<p>If you have some ideas of your own, please share them. We would be glad to hear our ideas.</p>
