										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today is Collector Car Appreciation Day. Try saying that three times fast.<br>It’s not just about old or fancy and unique cars. A while industry has been built around the automobile. Globally, revenue from just the sale of cars, themselves, was about $31.5 billon, with a growth rate of about 8%. That’s a lot of money and outdoes most stocks on the US Stock Exchange.</p>



<p><br>Aside from the cars, there is petrol, oil changes, car washes, hotel stays, advertising fees, photographers and models. It all adds up, and this money goes out to local businesses.<br>My dream car is a Mercedes, convertible from the early 1980s. I will probably never own one, but it’s nice to dream. It would likely be deep blue with brown leather seats.</p>



<p><br>What is your dream car?</p>



<p>For me, it’s more than a dream of having a particular car. I’m more than happy with the car that I have: a 2017 gray Jeep. I’m even happier that I’m no longer driving a 1991 van: ugly in every way.<br>For me, the Jeep reminds me that things can get better, no matter how I may feel at the moment. It’s also a reminder that my God is my source and my provider. And, because of this, I don’t have to worry about tomorrow.</p>



<p>If I begin to worry, as I am prone to do from time to time, I can go from 0 to panicked in .60 seconds. But, if I keep my eyes on God, and His Word in my heart (mind), there is really nothing to fear.</p>



<p><br>How can we celebrate Collector Car Appreciation Day? It may depend on where you live. If, for example, you live in a rural community, it may be that you or your neighbor has one of these in his or her yard. You may be able find a collector car at a local car dealership. You can also find photos and posters online. And there are car magazines. Finally, there are toy, model and remote control cars.<br></p>



<p>Perhaps, just learning something new is what matters. Personally, I would say that hope is what matters. And, it matters where we put on hope. My hope is in God: the Father, Son and Holly Spirit. Where do you find your hope?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>They say that, in life, it’s not how you start out but how you finish that matters. But when it comes to our financial life, how we start out can be a much greater indicator of how we will finish.</p>



<p>Yes, it’s true that Sam Walton was 44 when he started Walmart, but he had already built the foundation for his work when he started. And when he did start, he was very careful how he spent each and every dollar.</p>



<p>Far too many of us grown up without the appreciation of, and the understanding of money and how it works. Instead of being encouraged to save, we are encouraged to spend, even if we are bogged down with debt. And far too often, we find excuses, or blame someone else for our own financial decisions.</p>



<p>Now, we cannot yet travel back in time, so the best place to start is now, and the best way to start is with what we have. But we can’t stope there. Like taking a long trip, we need to know where we want to go and how to get there. It’s not going to be a quick flight but a long journey. And no one is going to be able to do it for you.</p>



<p>It may be a good idea at this time to enlist the help of a financial planner. Like a travel planner, he or she can help you figure out where you want to go, and the things that you can do to get there.</p>



<p>You also need to educate yourself. Dave Ramsey and Crown Financial Ministries are two excellent places to start.</p>



<p>You will need to become clear on your financial goals because a lack of clarity will slow progress and make it harder to go anywhere. In fact, you may wind up going backwards. And the further behind you start, the harder the trip is going to be. You can keep putting it off, but it is just going to keep getting harder to reach any sort of a goal.</p>



<p>You may have to start small, but a small start is better than nothing at all. Remember to reward yourself along the way, with a pat on the back or a small cheer. And don’t think of the time it will take, but remember the goal. The time will pass whether you make progress or not.</p>

<p>How much is enough? It’s a simple question, right? Last night, I got about four hours sleep. I got to bed late and woke up early. For a few, this might be enough sleep. For me, it’s not. Fortunately, I did get a little more sleep after going to an appointment that I had, but it still doesn’t seem like enough.</p>



<p>But there are less needed things that make it harder to know when enough is enough. For example, I got another lens for my camera last week. It wasn’t all that expensive compared to most of the lenses that Canon sells and it fills a “need” that my other lenses don’t. But it’s not a need, it’s a want.</p>



<p>Similarly, there is a mixer on display at Sam’s Club that looks so nice. But it’s not a need or a want, at least not now. And I don’t have room for it in my kitchen. Really the list of things could go on.</p>



<p>Conversely, there are things that I have in my life from time to time that I would rather not have: frustration, irritation and loneliness, just to name a few. These are just some of the things that I would rather not deal with.</p>



<p>Did you know that, according to the Bible, it’s the latter things — the loneliness and frustrations — that draw us closer to or make us more like God? I know it, but it’s easy to forget, especially when we’re “suffering” these things.</p>



<p>So, what are we to do? For the first, it’s best to have a budget. It needs to be one that we can stick with, and it should be as close to our actual needs as possible. I say this because things like groceries can be hard to predict, unless we really work hard at planning both the budget and our diet.</p>



<p>For the other things, we can learn to deal with them. Breathing exercises — taking a long breath in through the nose, holding it for a few seconds and a long breath out the mouth can help. Just counting slowly to ten can also help.</p>



<p>You see, most of our life depends on how we see it. If we see getting a parking ticket as a bad thing, it becomes a bad thing. But if we are able to see it as building patients, it can become a positive thing; that is, if we want to be more patient. For now, I think there might be enough time for another nap.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When it comes to our finances, there are a few rules that we should keep.</p>



<p><strong>Plan ahead</strong><br>One of the best ways to save money is to plan ahead. Have a budget, and stick to it. Plan your menus, and only buy what you can afford. Look for sales ahead of when you might need to make purchases.</p>



<p><strong>Pay yourself</strong><br>Set money aside for your future self. Call if an emergency fund or a fun fund. Emergency funds should have anywhere from $1,000 to three months take home pay, or more.</p>



<p><strong>Keep it simple</strong><br>One of the simplest ways to budget is to cash your check and put the money into envelopes. You may have envelopes for rent, food, gas and so forth. Each gets either a certain amount of money, or a percentage of your pay. If, for example, you have $100 for food, you have to figure out how to make that money last until next pay day.</p>



<p>If you don’t know where to start, begin by writing out some of your goals. Make sure that these goals are realistic, and give them a deadline. Take a look at where you are, and figure out small steps that you can take to get to where you want to go.</p>



<p><strong>Reward yourself</strong><br>Each time you take a step towards your goal, or whenever you reach a goal, remember to reward yourself. It could be as simple as a little cheer. Congratulate yourself. Pat yourself on the back. These small rewards can make you feel better about the direction you are taking, and help keep you on the right path.</p>



<p>Don’t put it off; the sooner you get started, the better. Make commitments to yourself, and respect yourself enough to stick to them. Your future self just may thank you for it.  Do these things and never forget that God is the one who provides for all of our needs.  </p>

<p>Somewhere, someone is working on the latest thing that we all need. It’s faster or smaller than the one before it and it can do things that we only hoped for just a few years ago.</p>



<p>Maybe you find it easy to save money and you enjoy doing it. I have done a little investing, and that’s kind of fun. Trying to pick the right stock and sometimes getting it right is kind of fun. But I don’t find saving all that exciting and, most of the time, I find it really hard.</p>



<p>It’s too easy to focus on the things that I want or need now. When I was in my twenties, I wasn’t thinking about when I would be in my forties or fifties. And when I was in my twenties, I had no idea what I would need at this time of my life.</p>



<p>Schools leave us may teach us the math needed to balance our bank accounts, but the really don’t teach us anything about our finances. For many, college is a time of getting into debt, and credit card companies are happy to give most of us credit as long as we have a pulse.</p>



<p>Maybe what we should do is make saving money fun. Maybe we could find a way to make a game out if it, like a board game or something. Maybe we could compete with others to see who is able to save up the most money. Just a thought.</p>



<p>Really, when it comes to our finances, we need to start with figuring out which direction that we want to take our lives. Without direction, it is hard to get anywhere.</p>



<p>If you truly want to save, it takes a plan. Like taking a road trip, you need to know where you wan to go so that you can make a plan to get there. Remember, however, that plans can change. There may be roadblocks and detours to your financial plans, but that doesn’t mean that you have to give up.</p>



<p>One other thing, whether we have a little or a lot, we need to trust God with our money. After all, it belongs to God, anyway. It may or may not be exciting giving a part of our money back to God and his work though the church, but God does promise a peace that passes all understanding to those who put their trust in him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I once heard the formula for making money: buy (low), sell (at a profit) and repeat. It’s pretty easy, if you can find a product or a number of products that sell well. And there are a number things to choose from.</p>



<p>Services<br>A service is something that you do over and over. You have a trade that someone else needs — plumbing, electrical work, auto repair, doctoring, or accounting — and you provide high quality service that people are willing to pay for.</p>



<p>Product<br>This may be something that you make yourself or something that you buy from a manufacturer. In case of a grocery or other store, you may deal with one or more vendors. More and more, stores are moving out of traditional brick and mortar stores and moving online, having either items in a warehouse, such as Amazon, or made to order and shipped to customers.</p>



<p>Investing<br>There are different items that individuals usually invest in. One is making a financial investment, usually through the purchase of stocks or bonds. Investors like Warren Buffett have a unique way of investing. Initially, Mr. Buffett purchased stocks, When he had enough money, he purchased the company Berkshire Hathaway, and consolidated all of his money into this company. Over time, Mr. Buffett has added more and more companies into his company and, at times, has been the richest man in the United States.</p>



<p>Another type of investment is real estate. Someone buys a type of some type of property, such as a house, apartment complex or a mall and uses to this property to make money. Some people fix up a piece of property and sell it for a profit. Others collect properties and use rent money, not only for paying back any loans, but also for making a profit.</p>



<p>It’s said that fortune favors the wealthy. The good news is that anyone with the desire to do so can put in the effort and amass wealth of some type. Countless individuals have moved to the United States with nearly nothing and have been able to build wealth for themselves and their family. Others have gone from being homeless to having millions in investments. But these stores are few and far between.</p>



<p>Yes, there are dangers in investing or selling, but there is also a danger in doing nothing. Over time, money looses it’s value and, if we don’t have a plan to grow our money, the money that we have today won’t buy as much as much tomorrow.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many of us think that we need to have everything now and that credit is required to buy what we need. This has allowed manufactures to raise the prices on goods and creators to make millions of dollars off of those whom they lend their money to. This may be good for the banker, but it can put individuals into a vicious cycle that can be difficult to get out of.</p>



<p>My advise, and I’ve learned this from making numerous mistakes of my own, is to start small and grow over time. Yes, there are the people like Sam Walton who took our millions of dollars of loans to start Walmart. It helped that he was the loan officer who loaned himself that much money. But for every story of a Sam Walton, there are numerous others who crashed and burned.</p>



<p>An oak tree starts as a small seed. In the first few years, it hardly seems like anything at all but, given time, it becomes a mighty oak tree. The thing isn’t to start big but to just get started. And the earlier that one gets started, the better. But be careful, it’s just as easy to get started with debt, and once someone gets into debt, it’s hard to get out.</p>

<p>Money and values<br>Did you know that the Bible mentions money more than 800 times? Money does several things. It is a tool that allows us to do the things that we want to do, taking place of the barter system. But money also shows us what is important to us.</p>



<p>When we get paid, if we work for someone else, we pay a portion of our income to our government in the form of taxes. This amount varies in amounts and in percentages. Many of us get money back at the end of the year, while others winding up having to send in a check, but taxes always have to be paid.</p>



<p>Some people give away a percentage of their income. If you give a tenth of your income, to a church or some other charitable organization, it’s called a tithe. The Bible tells us that everything that we receive, whether we realize it or not, comes from God and that we should give a portion back to him. Some say that it should be 10 percent, but others say that it is “whatever God puts on your heart to give.” I admit that it’s not always easy to give, but it is always a good idea.</p>



<p>Next, one should “pay” him or herself. This means taking money and setting it aside for the future. It can be in the form of an emergency fund, a fun fund, or something to be used to build up investments that, hopefully, outdo inflation.</p>



<p>One of the most important things that a person needs to survive is shelter, so rent or a mortgage would come next. And, so you don’t loose your property at some point in the future, it’s a good idea to include taxes in the equation, if applicable.</p>



<p>Utilities come next, unless you want to be cold in the winter or hot in the summer. There’s also water and, if you like, telephone and internet. Cable would likely fall under entertainment.</p>



<p>It’s also a good idea to spend a portion of your income on food, unless you are the Dragon Warrior (from “Kung Fu Panda”). I know that a person can survive on about $20 US a month on Raman noodles, but that kind of diet isn’t going to lend to long term health, and peanut butter and jelly isn’t much better. How much you want to spend on food is up to you. Consider your overall budget and use your best judgment.</p>



<p>There are going to be other bills: petrol or travel, auto repairs or bus fair. Car insurgence may be one of the bills. You may think that you don’t need money for entertainment, but you likely will. And clothes wear out, so include it.</p>



<p>Debts should be a small part of what our money goes to. Unfortunately, credit card companies, who will give a credit card even to a dog, make it super easy to get into debt at a young age, and make it very hard to get out. In addition, the cost of education has gone through the roof and can make it hard to set any money aside at the time when we most need to start investing.</p>



<p>Finally, there are things. We all want things, but we have to consider what they are worth to us. Not only do “things” take away the money that we could give back to God, but they take away from the money that we can invest in ourselves and in our future. If we put our money in things, unless they are truly investments, we are putting money into things that won’t last, will need repair and that will need to be taken care of. It’s okay to have things, but not at the cost of our freedom.</p>



<p>A budget is a good way to track all of this spending. It can be as complicated as software that helps us track where our money is going, or as simple as a system using envelopes that hold cash for each category of spending. Whoever you spend your money shows what you really value. As Matthew 6:21 (KJV) puts it, “For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.”</p>



<p>Where are your treasures? Do you put your money in things that will or will not last. It’s okay to have some of each but, remember, that balance is key. And the choices are up to you.</p>

<p>In a way, finances is like baking. I’ve been baking long enough to know that baking bread just takes a few ingredients. Unlike the bread at the store that has a list of 20 to 30 ingredients, home made bread just has a few: flower, water, yeast or some other leavening agent, unless it’s kosher, along with a few other optional ingredients, and time in an oven or furnace.</p>



<p>When it comes to personal finances, what it boils down to is doing a few things right, over and over again over a long period of time. The better of a start that we can get, and the more consistent that we are over time, not acting in faith one moment and fear in the next, the better we are likely to be in the long run.</p>



<p>The first thing to do is to have a plan. Part of this is not only knowing where the money that comes in will go but also that there will be money left over. It means having an overall plan for one’s life so that there’s no spending on the things that won’t take you where you want to go. It means knowing yourself to realize that that fishing boat may not be the best purchase or that that trip to Hawaii can wait another year.</p>



<p>It means that, if you plan to start your own business, that you are willing to put in the effort and allow for the time that it can take to start a new business. It may seem like some people have been able to start making money right away but, if you listen to them, they will tell you that it took, in most cases, years before they were making the kind of money that they were making. Often, they are the ones making the money because everyone else gave up.</p>



<p>Yes, budgeting is part of the planning process, but even the best budget is no good if you don’t follow it. A budget is simply a road map for where you want to go. If you don’t know where you want to go, or if you don’t follow the map, it simply won’t work.</p>



<p>The second key is to spend less than you take in. It’s not enough to have credit available at the end of the month, you need to have real money that you can use if needed. This means planning not only for the monthly bills but for the unexpected: job loss, emergency expenses and alike.</p>



<p>Finally, you need to invest. These days, there are so many ways to invest, even if it’s just sweat equity, or working extra hard so that you have extra money. Whether it’s sweat equity or some other form of investing, if you fail to invest, you will either not make any progress or you will fall behind over time. You can start at any time, but the earlier that you start, the sooner that you will be able to get where you want to be.</p>



<p>The stock market has never been easier to get into than now. If you are to do well, however, you have to do your research. Otherwise, your investing odds are likely no better than at the casino. Housing can be a great area to invest, but it also requires a lot of work. You or someone that you hire have to collect rent and take care of the units/homes. Plus, you have to work with banks and sellers, getting not only the best price but the best interest rate. You have to be able to take risks with other people’s money and, if things take a turn for the worse, you could be responsible for repaying a whole lot of money.</p>



<p>You, yourself could be an investment. Education is just one form of investment. If used properly, an education could double the money that you would have otherwise made. Or, it could just leave you paying off a student loan for years. My initial student loan was just under $30 thousand, but I hear of people who have loans that are closer to $150 thousand. However, I also heard of someone who had a $90 thousand loan who was able to pay off his student loan in a matter of a few years, simply by working harder at finding better jobs.</p>



<p>You don’t need a bunch of head knowledge to do well financially. You do, however, need to do certain things and do them well. It begins with knowing where you are and where you want to go. Most importantly, it begins with you.</p>

<p>Don’t want, want, have, need</p>



<p>Here’s an idea for your budget. Take a piece of paper, and divide it into four sections. You can draw four lines or fold it four ways. Index cards will work, too. Whatever works best for you.</p>



<p>Next, put these four headers in each of the four sections: Don’t want, Want, Have and Need.</p>



<p><strong>Don’t Want</strong><br>This is where you put the things that you don’t want: debt, overdrafts at your bank, being short on funds, having to wait to buy the things that you want. These are just a few examples. You might be tempted to start with a list of things that we want, but it might be better to start with a list of the things that we don’t want.</p>



<p><strong>Want</strong><br>Take the things that you don’t want and turn it around. If you don’t want to have to buy the things that you want or need, put “to be able to buy the things that I want/need.” If you wrote that you don’t want debt, put that you want to be debt free.</p>



<p><strong>Have</strong><br>This is the list of things that you have. It can include resources, but it can also include liabilities.</p>



<p><strong>Need</strong><br>This is a list of the things that you need but don’t already have.</p>



<p>Say, for example, you don’t want to keep your current vehicle for more than one more year. And you don’t want to take out a loan to buy a new/used one. You want a new car, and you want to save up for it.</p>



<p>Perhaps, you know that you want to find a vehicle for about $15,000. You may already have $5,000 saved up, so you will need to save up just over $833 a month for the next 12 months. Maybe that seems like a lot to set aside. You can revise your list.</p>



<p>Here’s another example. Maybe you don’t wan to stay home for the Christmas after next. You may decide that you want to go to Hawaii. If you decide that the trip will cost around $3,000, you are going to need to save up around $250 per month, and more if you want to book your flight early.</p>



<p>I don’t want to have debt, and I do want to pay off my Les Schwab account. Les Schwab is a tire and auto center. They do alignments, breaks and a few other things related to a car’s suspension. I have a balance of about $16, and almost a month before my next payment is due. Therefore I need about $16 dollars to pay off my balance.</p>



<p>I wish this were all I owed, but it’s a good place to start. Let me know if you find this tool helpful. I know that I plan to work more on my own list.</p>
