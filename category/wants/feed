<p>I find that I never really get everything that I want. Getting what I want is an endless persist. Now, I have everything that I need: family, a few friends, food and shelter to name a few. But there’s always some camera equipment or the latest computer that I’d like to have.</p>



<p>Statistics show that more money only makes a person happier to a certain point and once that financial plato is reached, it doesn’t add any more happiness.</p>



<p>As a believer in Christ, I find my joy in Him. There is also, as the Bible says, a peace that passes understanding. The weight of the world can weight heavy, but Jesus promised that He has overcome the world.</p>



<p>There are certainly things that I don’t want: minor irritations. Yet, I realize that there are others who have things much worse than I do.</p>



<p>I find that the best thing is to just be content with what I have. In the end, the Bible tells me that even the things that seem to bother me, God can use them to produce in me the patients that lead to endurance. No, I never will have all of the things that I want. That list is just too long. But I can choose joy. I can be thankful for what I have, in spite of what I don’t. And I can choose to trust God with the rest of it.</p>

<p>I don’t feel much like writing, today. Now, I have a choice. I can take the day off from writing, or I can just sit down and write.</p>



<p>There are several things that we can base our decisions on: things like priorities, values and emotions. And it’s likely that we make many of our choices base on more than one of these things.</p>



<p>Commercials show us a picture of an amazing looking picture of a burger or a pizza, not because their food looks that amazing, but so that we will remember then the next time we are hungry. The commercial may even make us hungry, so that we may associate being hungry with wanting that food.</p>



<p>The things we remember — friends and co-workers, gatherings or events — we remember most for how they make us feel.</p>



<p>The problem is that emotions are often a poor source of guidance when it comes to decision making. Say, for example, I really want to buy something, but don’t have the money. I can try to find a better price, I can wait and save up for what it is that I want, or I can buy it on credit, assuming that I have the available credit.</p>



<p>Some times, we have to put off doing the things that we want to do. Other times we may need to do the things that we don’t really feel like doing. It’s called self control, and our level of self control, along with other determining factors, will help us in our decision making and help guide our actions.</p>



<p>As with everything else, I like to write things out: get it on paper so that I can better sort things out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&#8220;Jesus loves me, this I know.  Just that sometimes, I have to go real slow.&#8221;</p>



<p>The trend has long been to do more, faster and better than before. I think we all feel the pressure in some way to get more done. Yet, even God took a day off.</p>



<p>There are at least a few ways to take a step back from our work. We just have to figure out what works best for us.</p>



<p>Plan ahead to do nothing. It could mean that you plan to set aside a few minutes each day, or it could mean that you plan to take a full day off each week. It also means figuring out what you may need to do or to put off in order to take this time.</p>



<p>By doing nothing, I don’t mean that you have to lie in bed and not move. What I’m talking about may look like one of the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Take a nap.</li>



<li>Call a friend.</li>



<li>Journal.</li>



<li>Pray or pick up a Bible.</li>



<li>Draw, crochet, cook or something else.</li>



<li>Take a leisurely walk.</li>
</ul>



<p>These are just a few ideas. The thing is that some of us — myself included — have to plan things or else they just don’t happen. And, for me, even putting something on a to-do list dues’t guarantee that it will get done.</p>



<p>The thing is to do something that you will enjoy doing. And keep it simple. Don’t think, as I some times do, my neighbor’s lawn needs cleaning, so I’m going to take care of that. Yes, there is a time for these things, but it cannot replace taking at least a little time to replenish ourselves.</p>



<p>Can taking time off be taken to extremes? Yes, everything can. That’s probably why God limited it to one day. And when God gave us 10 commandments, taking time off was just one of them — and not even the first.</p>



<p>We can keep ourselves so busy that we forget what we are doing it for. What we do, we should do out of love. Whether it’s working or taking time to help someone else, cooking, drawing or helping little old ladies across the street, we should do it out of love.</p>



<p>Remember, God loved us so much that He sent His one and only son to die for us so that He could restore a broken relationship between us. Yes, God had to plan ahead. He had to sacrifice something He loved. But He loved us that much.</p>

<p>The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. — Psalm 23:1 (KJV)</p>



<p>Even as a child, I had seen these words, but I didn’t really understand them — until recently.</p>



<p>We are, it seems, constantly bombarded with the message that we just need a little more. We need a little more money so that we can buy the latest tech. We need a little more fame and a little more popularity. We need a little more power, either over others or to control our own lives. You name it, whatever it is, it seems that we never have enough.</p>



<p>The need can become so great that we can spend our whole life looking for just a little more. Some will use and abuse others to get just a little more, while others will destroy whoever or whatever stands in the way of getting what they want. For some, it’s one more high, while for others, it’s one more drink to dull the pain. It’s why human trafficking, sex trafficking, the porn industry, drug wars and wars in general exist.</p>



<p>James 4:1-3 says, “From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members? Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not. Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.”<br>From the beginning, God promised that, if we put our faith in Him, He would provide all that we need; He would withhold no good thing. Yet, along came the serpent, when things were perfect, Adam and Eve believed the lie that they could have just a little more. So, we’ve been falling for the lie ever since.<br>The truth is, God really does love us and He really does want what is best for us. Oh, a little more can satisfy. But it doesn’t last. Snickers satisfy, but we still need to eat again an hour or two later. It’s the need for a little more — just a little — that’s never satisfied. It’s when we turn our eyes from God our provider and begin searching for a little more that our lives begin to lack the satisfaction that we all desire.<br>What can we do? Just knowing this can help. In John 10:10 (KJV), Jesus tells us that, “The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.” I trust God. Do you?</p>

<p>Don’t want, want, have, need</p>



<p>Here’s an idea for your budget. Take a piece of paper, and divide it into four sections. You can draw four lines or fold it four ways. Index cards will work, too. Whatever works best for you.</p>



<p>Next, put these four headers in each of the four sections: Don’t want, Want, Have and Need.</p>



<p><strong>Don’t Want</strong><br>This is where you put the things that you don’t want: debt, overdrafts at your bank, being short on funds, having to wait to buy the things that you want. These are just a few examples. You might be tempted to start with a list of things that we want, but it might be better to start with a list of the things that we don’t want.</p>



<p><strong>Want</strong><br>Take the things that you don’t want and turn it around. If you don’t want to have to buy the things that you want or need, put “to be able to buy the things that I want/need.” If you wrote that you don’t want debt, put that you want to be debt free.</p>



<p><strong>Have</strong><br>This is the list of things that you have. It can include resources, but it can also include liabilities.</p>



<p><strong>Need</strong><br>This is a list of the things that you need but don’t already have.</p>



<p>Say, for example, you don’t want to keep your current vehicle for more than one more year. And you don’t want to take out a loan to buy a new/used one. You want a new car, and you want to save up for it.</p>



<p>Perhaps, you know that you want to find a vehicle for about $15,000. You may already have $5,000 saved up, so you will need to save up just over $833 a month for the next 12 months. Maybe that seems like a lot to set aside. You can revise your list.</p>



<p>Here’s another example. Maybe you don’t wan to stay home for the Christmas after next. You may decide that you want to go to Hawaii. If you decide that the trip will cost around $3,000, you are going to need to save up around $250 per month, and more if you want to book your flight early.</p>



<p>I don’t want to have debt, and I do want to pay off my Les Schwab account. Les Schwab is a tire and auto center. They do alignments, breaks and a few other things related to a car’s suspension. I have a balance of about $16, and almost a month before my next payment is due. Therefore I need about $16 dollars to pay off my balance.</p>



<p>I wish this were all I owed, but it’s a good place to start. Let me know if you find this tool helpful. I know that I plan to work more on my own list.</p>
