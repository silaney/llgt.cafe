<p>Someone gave me a bag of chicken pars and it was a reminder that I needed to do certain things to keep myself safe. The chicken was frozen, but the bag was open, so I tied it before putting it into the refrigerator to thaw. I’m cooking it, now.</p>



<p>There are some general tips to keep in mind when safely handling meats that can help keep you and others from getting sick.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>*    Refrigerate or or freeze meats as soon as possible. 
*    Place meats at the bottom of the refrigerator or freezer so that they don’t leak onto other food items, especially ready to eat items. 
*    When thawing frozen meats, it’s a good idea to place them on something, like a plate or tray, so that they don’t leak on other things.  
*    It’s a good idea to cook meats promptly.  Once cooked, meats can be eaten or portioned out and put back into the refrigerator or freezer.  </code></pre>



<p>My chicken is almost done. It’s quite a lot so I plan to portion it out and freeze most of it. I hope these reminders help you. For more information on food safety, visit <a href="https://www.foodsafety.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.foodsafety.gov/</a>.</p>

<p>The power went out some time after 7:30 AM. I found out some time around 8 AM. It seems that the rain caused a tree limb to droop down low enough to hit a power line.</p>



<p>It’s an easy fix for the power company. But if I hadn’t seen the power company truck, I would not have known.</p>



<p>What if the power weren’t back on. What would I do if the power outage were more widespread? After a tornado hit neighboring towns a little over 2 years ago, the place where I work lost power for three days.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I have backup lights, and that’s a good place to start. But that’s only a start. I can’t make my instant coffee and, if the power were still out, I wouldn’t want to open my fridge.</p>



<p>So, what is it that I need if the power goes out for an extended time — say, a week or more?</p>



<p>Light<br>Light comes in handy. And, if you have light, it helps to see what you are doing. Along with that is the batteries to power that light.</p>



<p>Water<br>Water may be next, if the water fails to run. LifeStraws are also a good source of clean water. They filter water that is not drinkable and makes it drinkable.</p>



<p>Sheler<br>Assuming that there is no structural damage, as in an earthquake or tornado, some form of protection from the heat or cold may be needed. A battery powered fan may be useful. Extra blankets can also help; sleeping bags work, too.</p>



<p>Food<br>Canned goods may be important. Try to stick with things that you know that you will use, whether in an emergency or not. If you won’t eat it before it expires, you probably shouldn’t buy it.</p>



<p>Planning<br>This includes making plans of what to do if the power goes out. You may check to see if there is still radio. If there is, great. If not, wait. Phone service may or may not work. Check the weather to see if it is raining. You may also check to see if anyone else is without power. If they have power, it’s likely that the problem is in your home or apartment. If you know your neighbors, you may be able to help them with their needs.</p>



<p>Planning can help with a lot of issues in an emergency, such as a power outage. But it can’t solve every issue that might arise. I find that prayer goes a long way, too. In an emergency, teamwork goes much further. It’s a win-win situation.</p>

<p>Next week promises to be one of the hottest weeks of the summer. The fact that I grew up in the south doesn’t mean that I enjoy summer temperatures. Having experienced both warmer and cooler climates, I find it easier to deal with freezing temperatures than heat where you could fry an egg on the sidewalk. With that in mind, here are some ways that you can keep cool this summer.</p>



<p>The easiest way is to just stay inside. You can stay home, go shopping or visit the library or a museum. You may want to visit your favorite restaurant or coffee shop. You might also go for a drive, running the air conditioner or roll the windows down.</p>



<p>If you cannot stay indoors or, if air conditioning isn’t available, there are some other things you can do to keep cool. First, you can find shade. Shade trees are great. If you have two of them that are close enough together, you can tie a hammock between them. If trees aren’t available, you may want to make your own shade. For this, an umbrella can do wonders. It can be large or small — big enough for several people or big enough for one person. Either can help protect you from the heat of the hot sun.</p>



<p>There are other things that you can use to help with higher temperatures. I knew someone in cooking school who used a wet towel, cooled in the refrigerator, to keep cool. I knew others who used personal fans when it got hot.</p>



<p>Drinking enough water can help. Avoid drinking too much cold water too quickly. There are plenty of water bottles to choose from. Water works best, though you can also add just a little lemon juice if you like.</p>



<p>Of course you can just take a refreshing dip in a pool, lake or river. If one of these isn’t available, you may just want to cool down with water from the garden hose. Check to make sure that the water in the hose isn’t hot, first. Some places have a water park.</p>



<p>A little reminder: pets and people should never be left in a hot car. It’s far too dangerous, as temperatures can rise quickly. Also, hot sidewalks and pavement can burn a little cat’s or dog’s paws.</p>



<p>Summer should be a fun time of the year, filled with vacations and other memorable events. Don’t let the high temperatures keep you from making the most of your summer.</p>

<p>It can be hard at times to find something to write about. Motivation can be hard to come by and it can seem like the ink well of inspiration can be dry. There is still hope. There are things that we can do to come up with ideas.</p>



<p>For one, we can watch our favorite movie. Maybe there are some things that it can teach us and that we might want to write about it.</p>



<p>A walk might inspire us to write about something. I wrote a poem based on what I saw in the clouds and in the sky. It doesn’t have to be complicated. Some times we just need to write.</p>



<p>We can spend time with a friend or family member. We can talk, but it may be better if we just listen or ask questions.</p>



<p>We an brainstorm ideas of what to write about. Take five minutes just to write things down that might be of interest.</p>



<p>It’s not just true of writers. Painters and musicians can sometimes Ron low on inspiration. Some times we just need to get away from our craft for a while and experience life so that when we go back to the drawing board, so to speak, we fell refreshed. Other times, we just need to get at whatever we want to do. Inspiration can come with doing the work. Editing can come later.</p>

<p>When it comes to our finances, there are a few rules that we should keep.</p>



<p><strong>Plan ahead</strong><br>One of the best ways to save money is to plan ahead. Have a budget, and stick to it. Plan your menus, and only buy what you can afford. Look for sales ahead of when you might need to make purchases.</p>



<p><strong>Pay yourself</strong><br>Set money aside for your future self. Call if an emergency fund or a fun fund. Emergency funds should have anywhere from $1,000 to three months take home pay, or more.</p>



<p><strong>Keep it simple</strong><br>One of the simplest ways to budget is to cash your check and put the money into envelopes. You may have envelopes for rent, food, gas and so forth. Each gets either a certain amount of money, or a percentage of your pay. If, for example, you have $100 for food, you have to figure out how to make that money last until next pay day.</p>



<p>If you don’t know where to start, begin by writing out some of your goals. Make sure that these goals are realistic, and give them a deadline. Take a look at where you are, and figure out small steps that you can take to get to where you want to go.</p>



<p><strong>Reward yourself</strong><br>Each time you take a step towards your goal, or whenever you reach a goal, remember to reward yourself. It could be as simple as a little cheer. Congratulate yourself. Pat yourself on the back. These small rewards can make you feel better about the direction you are taking, and help keep you on the right path.</p>



<p>Don’t put it off; the sooner you get started, the better. Make commitments to yourself, and respect yourself enough to stick to them. Your future self just may thank you for it.  Do these things and never forget that God is the one who provides for all of our needs.  </p>

<p>Is there something that you want to remember? Apple recently came out with a new product called Air Tags. These little disks help you find the things that you may have lost. The aren’t designed to help you remember where you put them but to help you find them when you misplace them or already forgot where you put them.</p>



<p>But what if there’s something that you want to remember? There are a few things that you can do that might help.</p>



<p>Take a picture. In fact, if you can, put together a photo album. Photographs are one thing that can help bring back memories. You may put together a family photo album or an album of your favorite pictures. It may seem small, but you never know when these pictures might come in handy.</p>



<p>Make a list. I use my phone’s note taking app most of the time when I need to make a list. That is, assuming that it is a small list. Other tricks I’ve used is to make a mental note of how many things I intend to buy when I go shopping. If I can remember that I need to buy five things, it’s easier to remember that I need milk, eggs, bread, ground beef and — what’s that last thing — ice cream.</p>



<p>Keep a journal. I have kept several journals over the years. I have a few that are hand written books, stuffed with pictures, scraps of papers and other things. After I bought my last computer, I started doing more of my journaling digitally. I just enjoy writing, though it can help to go back and read what has been written from time to time. I just find it relaxing.</p>



<p>Make a note. I had found that, if I want to remember something, especially a lot of somethings, not cards work well. They can work great if you are still in school. What I do is put one piece of information on one side of the card and another piece of information on the other side. For example, I might put “Toast” on one side of the card and “pain grillé” on the other, if I wanted to learn the French word for toast. I used to carry as many as a hundred or so index cards and take out the ones that I knew as I learned them.</p>



<p>Tell someone else. Some times it helps to just tell someone else what you need to remember. It’s not so much as whether or not the other person remembers as much as hearing ourselves say something can often help us remember things better.</p>



<p>Of course, another way is to just take care of ourselves. Eating a healthy diet, getting adequate exercise and sleep can go a long way to helping us with our memory as we grow older. Keeping an active mind and imagination can also go a long way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I worked around 25 years in food service before going into assembly and then into manufacturing. Working in food service allowed me to travel to many places that I might not have been, and it has allowed me to meet people that I might have otherwise met.</p>



<p>I think that my travels in time have taught me a more about people than anything else — and even a little about myself — yet there are some things that I have learned about cooking that may be useful.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most important thing that I have learned is the importance of learning the basics. Whether it’s searing the perfect steak or baking a beautiful cake, there are basics to every recipe. It may be a technique for mixing or one for seasoning. These techniques give us a foundation for everything that we cook and can help determine the quality of our food.</p>



<p>Practice, practice, practice. Because most of the things that are done when cooking seem pretty easy, doesn’t mean that we can do them well the first time. Some say that you have to do something a couple of thousand times before you are actually good at it. Others say that you have to spend so many hour doing something new before you master it. Either way, if you want to go from good to great, practice.</p>



<p>There are a number of books and videos that will teach you the basics of cooking. I spent a year in a cooking school learning the basics of French cuisine. None of it is really all that complicated, but the more that you work at the basics, the better you will get.</p>



<p>It is also important to have everything in place when you start cooking. In cooking school, they called it mise en place, which is a fancy French way of saying “get it together.” It begins with planning ahead, making lists and following recipes if needed.</p>



<p>Having things together not only means preparing all of your ingredients and having them in front of you as you prepare to cook, it means being ready mentally. It means having the right tools for the job and having the right attitude.</p>



<p>One of the key ingredients is love, so make sure to use it in everything that you make. Long before I started working in the food service industry, I enjoyed cooking. And I enjoyed serving others, which helps, because food service truly is a service industry. Without love, not only will our cooking suffer, but we will suffer, also.</p>



<p>Clean as you go. It’s not always easy, and it certainly is easier if you have someone to do it for you. Yet, it is important to keep your work area clean. It not only looks better, but it might also help prevent food borne illnesses.</p>



<p>Don’t be afraid to try new things. Personally, I don’t follow recipes all that much. Instead, when I cook, I like to try new things. Just know who you are cooking for. You may not want to try certain things, and you may not want to try something new in a cooking competition.</p>



<p>This last one is less about cooking and more about the people whom you cook for. I found that, if I cook for more than one person, there is at least the possibility that at least one of them will not like something that you made. Just saying, you cannot please all the people all of the time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The search for perfection may be nearly as elusive as the search for the fountain of youth. We may, perhaps, be able to obtain near perfection in at least one area of our lives, but it’s usually fleeting. And we can always find someone who has more money, knows more or is “more beautiful.”<br>Perfection really should not be our goal. Instead, our goal should be continual improvement. If we set out to do something new with the thought that we will execute our plan perfectly on our first attempt, we are likely to become discouraged and give up. Instead, if we realize that learning is a process of trying new things and failing often, then we are more likely to continue, even after numerous “failures.”<br>Failure is a tricky thing. It can cause us to quit, or we can say to ourselves, “That didn’t work. What can I learn from it?” If children saw failure as some adults do, many of us would still be unable to walk, talk or do simple tasks that many of us take for granted.<br>Television, movies, magazines, advertising and social media don’t really do us any favors in this area. Advertising, for example, shows us the prettiest of people, and always so happy, doing the things that we wish we could do and using a product that we never realized just how much we now need. Then, when we get that thing, our lives still don’t match the image presented to us in the ad.<br>Whatever it is that we want to accomplish, whether it’s something big or something small, we should realize that it may take several attempts to get the results that we are looking for. And we aught to be willing to fail more than once, even if it allows others to see that we aren’t perfect. Know this, they aren’t perfect either.<br>There’s one other thing to keep in mind. Often, we limit our view on the different areas of our life. In finances, for example, we limit our idea of success to money, homes and cars. But family and friends are a treasure that cannot be bought with money. Real love cannot be purchase with a credit or debit card. And there is so much more to beauty than perfect skin. Keep that in mind when you look in the mirror or are tempted to compare yourself with someone else.</p>

For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.”<br>Often, we lack faith because we aren’t really sure what we believe. Any time we start anything new, it takes time to learn what we need to know. Hopefully, we can learn the fundaments early, but that may take years. Studies like law and medicine, and even culinary arts can take years to master and, still, one can never learn everything that there is to learn. Odd thing is that there are a wide variety of opinions in any field of study. And religion is no exception.<br>If we aren’t sure what we believe, it’s easy to be swayed by the latest thing that we’ve heard. It is important, therefore, to be careful who we are listening to. At the same time, it can be good to seek out different opinions, even if we think that we’ve already heard it all.</p>



<p>Current social media is often set up to flood us with one view, while sometimes blocking other options, whether by our choice or by the choice of an algorithm, or both.<br>Not knowing affects other areas of our lives, too. Studies have shown that, the earlier people know their life’s path, the more successful they will be in reaching their goals. Not knowing what we want to do can cause us to waste not only money, but years of our lives. Yet, even if we missed getting an early start, it’s never too late to decide what we want to do with our lives.<br>There are a few things that can help us determine what we might do next. We cannot say that what we do next will determine the rest of our lives, for too much is outside our control. But we can decide what direction we would like to take.<br>The first thing that we can do is to write down some goals. If you don’t know where you want to go, it becomes easy to live life in a rut, where it may seem like we aren’t getting anywhere. Yet, even these times can teach us something. I like to use a computer to type out my goals.<br>Be specific. Instead of writing that you want make a lot of money and retire early, determine how much money that you need to retire, when you would like to retire, a date you will start saving and a clear plan on how much you will need to save or invest each year between now and retirement. Also, have a clear idea of what you want retirement to look like. Do you want to live on a beach or a mansion?<br>Be realistic. It’s okay to dream big. One of my favorite books was Ann Kiemel’s book, “I Love the Word Impossible,” where she talks about dreaming things that only God can do. But I do not want and will never play pro football in the NFL, and I will never become a sky diver. No thank you. But there are lots of things that I can decide that I want to do and, though I may never perfect any particular skill, I can get better at just about anything I work at.<br>Another thing we can do is to talk to friends — those that know us best. Find out what they think that we are or might be good at. Years ago, someone told me that I should have been a librarian because of my many interests. Today, I use that in my blog.<br>Finally, start small. Intentionally, figure out what the least you can do is and do that. If you want to run a marathon, start with a five or ten minute walk. Don’t try, on day one, to run 5 or 6 miles because you are much more likely to give up. Do this with any new habit that you want to incorporate into your routine. I made a list of things that I want to do each day on a dry erase board and I check them off as I do them. My list has 16 things to do and I don’t put things that I’m already in the habit of doing. This can also help limit the time that we spend checking emails, taking phone calls and checking social media.<br>Being free to do whatever can be nice, but having and reaching goals can give us a sense of purpose. It can also help keep us from waking up and realizing that we’ve “wasted” our time on this Earth. Knowing what we believe also helps us when we pray. And if you need wisdom, ask God.</p>

<p>Today is National Common Courtesy Day, and it is observed each year on November 21. There are several ways that you can participate.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Send a note to a friend or loved one.</li>



<li>Do household chores that you normally wouldn’t do.</li>



<li>Give someone flowers.</li>



<li>Rake someone’s yard.</li>



<li>Pick up trash on a walk.</li>



<li>Say “thank you” to the person who bags your groceries.</li>



<li>Say “hi” to a stranger.</li>



<li>Say “please” when you ask for something.</li>



<li>Use your manners when eating a meal.</li>



<li>Hold the door open for someone else.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are several ways to show common courtesy. And we could all think of a few. Unfortunately, it’s all too easy to miss at least some opportunities because, it seems, we are all so busy. If we’re not running to the next major event, we’re answering a text or checking social media. It seem “safer” to stay busy with social media than to risk putting ourselves out there to help others.</p>



<p>It’s called “Common Courtesy” because it probably was more common. There was no social media to lean on, and there probably weren’t as many things that “had to be done.” But when we realize all that God has done for us, courtesy is something that we want to show, common or not.</p>



<p>Even in the past, common courtesy was something that had to be learned. We aren’t born with this trait. In fact, when we are young, we tend to focus on our own needs. We must not only be told to be courteous, but we must see someone else be courteous. If someone tells us to be courteous and they themselves are rude, we’re not likely to “do as they say.”</p>



<p>Remember to show courtesy, and not only today, especially if little ones are watching. And don’t just be courteous out where others can see you. Common courtesy begins in the home.</p>
