										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Happy July 4th. Yesterday, I finished my first book in a series called “Letters from a Time Traveler.” It’s not much more than 3,000 words but, still, I’m excited about it. It comes on the heels of having finished my fourth LLGT Cafe magazine. And I’m certainly excited about that.</p>



<p>What gets you excited? Now, there are several things I enjoy: a long walk on a cool day, taking pictures, spending time with a friend or cooking a meal for friends are just some examples. However, few things really get me excited and finishing a writing project is one of them.</p>



<p>You probably already know that excitement produces endorphins in the brain and that is what makes us feel good. It’s too bad that these chemicals aren’t easier to produce. I think that social media can produce these chemicals, and that may be part of the reason that so many are addicted to social media. I consider myself a recovering addict.</p>



<p>Exercise is a better source than social media. Too many of us — myself included — get our “fix” on social media, passing by exercise or actual social interaction, and it’s sad. Real relationships involve risk. But relationships are worth that risk.</p>



<p>In the long run, exercise is much better than inactivity, even if it’s cooking a meal. I got one of those watches that tracks my activity. If I sit down too long, it lets me know. We don’t need to be excited all of the time. Unfortunately, if we don’t find it in things that we enjoy, then we are more likely to look for it in things that we would rather avoid.</p>



<p>So, what is it that gets you excited? For me, it’s the prospect of helping others.</p>

<p>How much is enough? It’s a simple question, right? Last night, I got about four hours sleep. I got to bed late and woke up early. For a few, this might be enough sleep. For me, it’s not. Fortunately, I did get a little more sleep after going to an appointment that I had, but it still doesn’t seem like enough.</p>



<p>But there are less needed things that make it harder to know when enough is enough. For example, I got another lens for my camera last week. It wasn’t all that expensive compared to most of the lenses that Canon sells and it fills a “need” that my other lenses don’t. But it’s not a need, it’s a want.</p>



<p>Similarly, there is a mixer on display at Sam’s Club that looks so nice. But it’s not a need or a want, at least not now. And I don’t have room for it in my kitchen. Really the list of things could go on.</p>



<p>Conversely, there are things that I have in my life from time to time that I would rather not have: frustration, irritation and loneliness, just to name a few. These are just some of the things that I would rather not deal with.</p>



<p>Did you know that, according to the Bible, it’s the latter things — the loneliness and frustrations — that draw us closer to or make us more like God? I know it, but it’s easy to forget, especially when we’re “suffering” these things.</p>



<p>So, what are we to do? For the first, it’s best to have a budget. It needs to be one that we can stick with, and it should be as close to our actual needs as possible. I say this because things like groceries can be hard to predict, unless we really work hard at planning both the budget and our diet.</p>



<p>For the other things, we can learn to deal with them. Breathing exercises — taking a long breath in through the nose, holding it for a few seconds and a long breath out the mouth can help. Just counting slowly to ten can also help.</p>



<p>You see, most of our life depends on how we see it. If we see getting a parking ticket as a bad thing, it becomes a bad thing. But if we are able to see it as building patients, it can become a positive thing; that is, if we want to be more patient. For now, I think there might be enough time for another nap.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I don’t feel much like writing, today. Now, I have a choice. I can take the day off from writing, or I can just sit down and write.</p>



<p>There are several things that we can base our decisions on: things like priorities, values and emotions. And it’s likely that we make many of our choices base on more than one of these things.</p>



<p>Commercials show us a picture of an amazing looking picture of a burger or a pizza, not because their food looks that amazing, but so that we will remember then the next time we are hungry. The commercial may even make us hungry, so that we may associate being hungry with wanting that food.</p>



<p>The things we remember — friends and co-workers, gatherings or events — we remember most for how they make us feel.</p>



<p>The problem is that emotions are often a poor source of guidance when it comes to decision making. Say, for example, I really want to buy something, but don’t have the money. I can try to find a better price, I can wait and save up for what it is that I want, or I can buy it on credit, assuming that I have the available credit.</p>



<p>Some times, we have to put off doing the things that we want to do. Other times we may need to do the things that we don’t really feel like doing. It’s called self control, and our level of self control, along with other determining factors, will help us in our decision making and help guide our actions.</p>



<p>As with everything else, I like to write things out: get it on paper so that I can better sort things out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Trying to get tech to work can seem like getting a three year old to clean up his room.&nbsp; Yet, tech doesn’t have the advantage of being loved, which makes it all the more frustrating when we can’t get it to do what we want. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t know about you, but my frustrations range from phones that mysteriously turn on, open an app and begin doing whatever it pleases.&nbsp; Usually, I can tell that my phone is on because it warms up in my pocket.&nbsp; By the time I notice it, however, the batter has drained half its power.</p>



<p>Software can be another problem. While Adobe offers some of the best software, it can also be some of the most frustrating.&nbsp; Presently, I’m trying to get my computer connected to the internet, but its being very trying. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Love is so important; it should be included in the list of things that we need in order to survive.&nbsp; Like water, air and shelter, love might just be key to survival.&nbsp; And though it may not be necessary for every individual, it is for the survival of the human race. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, we can survive without love, but we cannot thrive without it.&nbsp; And though we can just survive, the better option is to thrive. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Can we find love if and when we are alone?&nbsp; I think so.&nbsp; Why, you may ask? &nbsp; Or, how?&nbsp; It’s simple.&nbsp; If you can find someone else who needs love and, if you are willing to be open and vulnerable, you can find love. &nbsp;</p>



<p>First Corinthians 13 reminds us that, if we don’t have love, our actions, our very lives are useless.&nbsp; For the Bible tells us that God, Himself, is love.&nbsp; We love because He first loved us. &nbsp;</p>



<p>If love is so important, how do we find it?&nbsp; First, search for God.&nbsp; You can “ask Him into your heart.”&nbsp; It’s kind of like giving God your heart.&nbsp; God already owns everything.&nbsp; We just have to surrender our will to His. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, we can decide to meet others where they are.&nbsp; Activity look to help others, meeting then where they are and not where we wish they were.&nbsp; God met us where we were when He sent Jesus to die on a cross.&nbsp; We meet Him when we accept His gift.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>You could say I’ve had a hard life. It could be said of just about anybody. Live long enough and there are bound to be difficult times, from not getting the new toy that you want to loosing someone you love: even facing your own mortality.</p>



<p>It’s said that for every negative comment, we need ten positive comments to counter the one negative. The negative in our lives just carries more weight in our minds. But it is possible to overcome that tendency.</p>



<p>Every moment of every day, we are choosing what we are focused on. We may be focused on our work, or on the fact that we aren’t able to work right now. We may be focused on someone we love, or we may be focused on the person who cut us off in traffic.</p>



<p>The important thing to remember is that we can choose what we focus on, and what we choose to think about the things that are going on in our lives. Or we can just let our circumstances determine what we think about.</p>



<p>Dan Miller, author of the book “48 Days to the Work You Love”, and creator of the podcast by the same name speaks about the view of the family that he was raised in. He says that his life may have been hard, that he had to do things that he may not have enjoyed doing, that others might complain about, but that these things helped him become the man that he is, today. And he is grateful for this.</p>



<p>James 1:2-3 (KJV) says, “My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.”</p>



<p>I’ll admit that this has been a really difficult verse for me to get a hold of. Yet, after having survived many difficult challenges, I see that these hard times have made me more patient and, perhaps, better able to help others with problems that they are having.</p>



<p>Right now, fear is an emotion that a lot of people are likely dealing with. Fear of sickness, fear of the future, and fear of loss; these can all be difficult to deal with. But there are other things that we can choose to put our attention on.</p>



<p>For one, we can choose to be thankful for what we do have, rather than focus on what we don’t: what we still have, instead of what we’ve lost. Here’s one: we can always have hope.</p>



<p>Another thing we can do is we can make plans. I might not be able to take that trip to Oregon that I was hoping to take, but I can plan to meet with my friend to have pizza for dinner, tomorrow.</p>



<p>You may need to turn off the TV, and stop watching the evening news. You may need to stop listing to some of the negative voices in you life. When someone says or does something that may be hurtful or negative, you can just say “thank you,” and move on. You don’t have to dwell on it so that it ruins your day.</p>



<p>Find one thing that you are truly thankful for and dwell on that. It could be a relationship, a memory, or a future hope. Try and make it something that no one can take away.</p>



<p>Philippians 4:8 (KJV) says, “Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.”</p>



<p>You can wait for your circumstances to change, or you can begin to make your own changes. It’s your choice.</p>

<p>Love can be a powerful emotion. It feels good to be in love and to spend time with those we love. But love is also an action word: mainly, love gives and love serves.</p>



<p>Love does not take by force, but it does receive. It is not controlling, but is always looking out for the best for and in others. Real love takes time, and is built on trust. We may be attracted to someone, but real love cannot be rushed.</p>



<p>Love causes us to do things, sometime strange things, for those we love. This could range from buying flowers to making lifelong commitments, as in marriage.</p>



<p>Love is not built on feelings, and it does not always feel good; pain and frustration can be very real parts of love.</p>



<p>Romans 5:8 (KJV) tells us that, “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”</p>



<p>I’m so glad the John 3:16 doesn&#8217;t say that God so loved the world that he strongly considered sending his son to die so that we might have life.</p>



<p>Without love, the world would be a very lonely place.</p>

<p>I think I know how the Hebrews felt: you know, the ones who had lived in Egypt and God brought them out and led them into the wilderness. God had promised to bring the Hebrews into the promise land, but they didn’t believe him and, more than once, began to complain about Moses and about what God was doing.</p>



<p>There are several things that can cloud our judgment. Fear is a bid one. Most often, the things that we fear aren’t real, but our bodies and our minds can react to things that are not real in the same way as things that are.</p>



<p>Fear can freeze us in inaction or it can cause us to run away. It can be something that we fear will happen or something that we fear won’t happen. It can even be something that has happened and we fear what might happen next.</p>



<p>Anger can cause us to do irrational things. Unfortunately, most of the time, anger is caused by a miscommunication or a misunderstanding. Anger is responsible for fights and, in the worst cases, murder.</p>



<p>One of the best ways to counter anger is with humility. We have to realize that we don’t know everything and try to get to the root of the anger, whether it is our own anger or someone else’s.</p>



<p>Sadness and loneliness can also affect our thinking. These feelings can lead to depression. The worst part is that the depressed person tends to be a loner and doesn’t often seek help.</p>



<p>Love can also cloud our vision. What I mean is the kind of love that makes us feel funny or all warm inside. This kind of love can cause us to do things that we wouldn’t otherwise do. And, believe me, I’ve been there more often than I care to admit.</p>



<p>Perhaps the best thing we can do when we have these emotions is to begin to ask ourselves questions. Are the things that we are feeling reasonable? Is it possible that our thinking is wrong? What are these emotions doing to me? If possible, find someone else to help explore these questions: someone whom you trust to help find the right answers.</p>



<p>Emotions in themselves aren’t bad. Even the Bible tells us that it is okay to be angry, but it warns us not to sin and not to let the sun go down on our anger. The thing is to learn to control our emotions, instead of letting them control us. When we can do that, the happier — or at least content — we are likely to be.</p>

<p>Dr. James Dobson wrote a book asking whether or not we could trust our emotions. In summation, his conclusion was “no”. And yet, it can be easy to base what we do on our emotions.</p>



<p>Emotions can be hard to understand, and it can take a lifetime to learn how to deal with them. From birth, we cry to let others know that something is wrong. Yet, when we are born, we are made to cry as a reminder that we are to breath.</p>



<p>We think of some emotions as positive and some as negate, but is it the emotion that is either good or bad, or is it how we react to test emotions. All of us experience different emotions at times: joy, love, fear and anger. What many of us don’t realize is that we have the ability to choose how we deal with these emotions.</p>



<p>There are different ways that we can deal with our emotions. One way is to express how we feel. If we feel happy, we smile or laugh. And there’s nothing wrong with that. But if someone angers us, we may strike out at that person which is something that doesn’t often help.</p>



<p>We can suppress our feelings. Rather than deal with pain, it might be easier just to avoid emotions all together. If there’s one emotion that overwhelms us, maybe we can learn to just hide all of them and not deal with any of them.</p>



<p>Or, we can learn to deal with our emotions. Our emotions still have something to tell us, that things are going well, that something needs to be fixed or that there is a need for healing.</p>



<p>It may take someone else to help us understand our emotions. The anger that we feel now may be based at least in part on something that happened earlier. One thing can build upon another and, before we know it, our emotions are out of control</p>



<p>Each of us needs to learn to control our emotions, but burying them isn’t the answer. It’s likely not properly dealing with our emotions is what leads to most addictions. The answer begins when we start asking questions like:</p>



<p>What’s really bothering me?<br>Is there something that hasn’t been dealt with?<br>What would I need to do to improve my mood?<br>What am I thankful for?<br>What really matters?<br>Is what I believe about something really true?</p>



<p>It helps to know what we are loved. Whether we realize it or not, someone love us. Whether we know it or not, God loves us. Just remember that, even in these hard times, you are not — I am not — alone.</p>
