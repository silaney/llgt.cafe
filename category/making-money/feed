<p>Today is Collector Car Appreciation Day. Try saying that three times fast.<br>It’s not just about old or fancy and unique cars. A while industry has been built around the automobile. Globally, revenue from just the sale of cars, themselves, was about $31.5 billon, with a growth rate of about 8%. That’s a lot of money and outdoes most stocks on the US Stock Exchange.</p>



<p><br>Aside from the cars, there is petrol, oil changes, car washes, hotel stays, advertising fees, photographers and models. It all adds up, and this money goes out to local businesses.<br>My dream car is a Mercedes, convertible from the early 1980s. I will probably never own one, but it’s nice to dream. It would likely be deep blue with brown leather seats.</p>



<p><br>What is your dream car?</p>



<p>For me, it’s more than a dream of having a particular car. I’m more than happy with the car that I have: a 2017 gray Jeep. I’m even happier that I’m no longer driving a 1991 van: ugly in every way.<br>For me, the Jeep reminds me that things can get better, no matter how I may feel at the moment. It’s also a reminder that my God is my source and my provider. And, because of this, I don’t have to worry about tomorrow.</p>



<p>If I begin to worry, as I am prone to do from time to time, I can go from 0 to panicked in .60 seconds. But, if I keep my eyes on God, and His Word in my heart (mind), there is really nothing to fear.</p>



<p><br>How can we celebrate Collector Car Appreciation Day? It may depend on where you live. If, for example, you live in a rural community, it may be that you or your neighbor has one of these in his or her yard. You may be able find a collector car at a local car dealership. You can also find photos and posters online. And there are car magazines. Finally, there are toy, model and remote control cars.<br></p>



<p>Perhaps, just learning something new is what matters. Personally, I would say that hope is what matters. And, it matters where we put on hope. My hope is in God: the Father, Son and Holly Spirit. Where do you find your hope?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I once heard the formula for making money: buy (low), sell (at a profit) and repeat. It’s pretty easy, if you can find a product or a number of products that sell well. And there are a number things to choose from.</p>



<p>Services<br>A service is something that you do over and over. You have a trade that someone else needs — plumbing, electrical work, auto repair, doctoring, or accounting — and you provide high quality service that people are willing to pay for.</p>



<p>Product<br>This may be something that you make yourself or something that you buy from a manufacturer. In case of a grocery or other store, you may deal with one or more vendors. More and more, stores are moving out of traditional brick and mortar stores and moving online, having either items in a warehouse, such as Amazon, or made to order and shipped to customers.</p>



<p>Investing<br>There are different items that individuals usually invest in. One is making a financial investment, usually through the purchase of stocks or bonds. Investors like Warren Buffett have a unique way of investing. Initially, Mr. Buffett purchased stocks, When he had enough money, he purchased the company Berkshire Hathaway, and consolidated all of his money into this company. Over time, Mr. Buffett has added more and more companies into his company and, at times, has been the richest man in the United States.</p>



<p>Another type of investment is real estate. Someone buys a type of some type of property, such as a house, apartment complex or a mall and uses to this property to make money. Some people fix up a piece of property and sell it for a profit. Others collect properties and use rent money, not only for paying back any loans, but also for making a profit.</p>



<p>It’s said that fortune favors the wealthy. The good news is that anyone with the desire to do so can put in the effort and amass wealth of some type. Countless individuals have moved to the United States with nearly nothing and have been able to build wealth for themselves and their family. Others have gone from being homeless to having millions in investments. But these stores are few and far between.</p>



<p>Yes, there are dangers in investing or selling, but there is also a danger in doing nothing. Over time, money looses it’s value and, if we don’t have a plan to grow our money, the money that we have today won’t buy as much as much tomorrow.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many of us think that we need to have everything now and that credit is required to buy what we need. This has allowed manufactures to raise the prices on goods and creators to make millions of dollars off of those whom they lend their money to. This may be good for the banker, but it can put individuals into a vicious cycle that can be difficult to get out of.</p>



<p>My advise, and I’ve learned this from making numerous mistakes of my own, is to start small and grow over time. Yes, there are the people like Sam Walton who took our millions of dollars of loans to start Walmart. It helped that he was the loan officer who loaned himself that much money. But for every story of a Sam Walton, there are numerous others who crashed and burned.</p>



<p>An oak tree starts as a small seed. In the first few years, it hardly seems like anything at all but, given time, it becomes a mighty oak tree. The thing isn’t to start big but to just get started. And the earlier that one gets started, the better. But be careful, it’s just as easy to get started with debt, and once someone gets into debt, it’s hard to get out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’m not exactly sure how old I was when I took my first photograph. I know that my dad had a camera and took pictures of the family as well as for work. I also know that some time around 1980, my mom took a photograph class at the university and that’s about the time I became interested in taking pictures.</p>



<p>A lot has changed over the years in the area of photography. For example, it seems that just about everyone has access to a camera these days. They’re on phones and security devices, drones and computers. When I started taking pictures, it wasn’t that way. There were no digital cameras and, if there were, they weren’t available to the general public. There were fewer photographers, especially in photography’s early years and even fewer who stood out for the work they did. Now, it seems that we’re all photographers and, it would seem, that it is even harder to stand out among other photographers.</p>



<p>Photography has always been fairly expensive. Companies like Eastman Kodak made it easier for families to own cameras in 1888 with the introduction of the Kodak. The Brownie was another film camera. Now, there are actually more camera companies, and a lot more cameras and camera types to choose from. And, though there isn’t the price of film and developing to keep in mind, but there is the price of the price of the camera, itself, memory cards, batteries and anything else that you care to add. Oh, and the first digital cameras — the first DSLRs — they had a price tag of about $5,000.</p>



<p>The quality of cameras and the photographs that they take has changed over the years. The first cameras were actually boxes with just a hole for a lens. An artist had to draw or paint the image. Film was later introduced and now we have film and digital. And the quality of both has greatly increased over time. That DSLR that cost $5,000 would have hardly produced a picture any larger than a post card. And it wasn’t until around the year 2000 that digital cameras even came close to producing the quality of images that a film camera could do. Now, we can do things with digital cameras that one could hardly imagine doing with film.</p>



<p>When I started taking pictures, I also learned how to develop black and white film and prints. I had access to a darkroom and supplies and I could spend hours working on just a few images. It was by no means, instant and color film could take a week or more to get back for a photo lab. With film, with the exception of instant cameras, there was no way to check the quality of your pictures until you developed the film or had someone else develop it. Now, we just have to look at the back of our camera or on our smart phone. We can even have a camera set up remotely and check the images on a smart device.</p>



<p>Laws have changed somewhat over the years. It’s still legal to photograph others in public. But it’s harder, in some cases to use these pictures. Rules of courtesy haven’t changed. Rules of composition and what makes a “good” photograph still hasn’t changed. And everyone is a great photographer until he or she begins comparing their work to the work of other, more experienced, photographers.</p>



<p>There are more ways to make money as a photographer, now, but there is also more competition. A single photographer can produce hundreds of thousands of images and sell them online, yet there there is still a need to fill photography gaps. Anyone can photograph a wedding, but only one photographer may have the style that suits a particular customer’s needs. It takes time and effort to get into photography as a career these days. It takes time to develop one’s style and to make significant improvement in image quality. Then it takes time for others to get to know and appreciate your work. And, if you want to make big bucks, you have to find clients with the needs and the resources to pay that money.</p>



<p>I still own a film camera — a Minox —but I don’t really use it. The last pictures I took were black and white and, without access to a dark room, these pictures took at least 2 weeks to get back. Also, when I got the pictures back, they were badly underexposed. I don’t know, but it was a fairly recent purchase and I think there is a problem with the light meter. I have a really nice camera, now. It’s the nicest camera I’ve ever had. But, these days, I get most of my pictures with my phone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you are thinking about picking up and traveling, whether you plan on spending the year traveling around your area or you plan on spending some time in another country, there are more options now then there were just twenty or thirty years ago. Internet and high speed communication has not only allowed people in places outside of the United States to do jobs that once had to be done domestically but also allow people to take many jobs wherever they want.</p>



<p>You may not need a computer for this first one, though many restaurants use computers these days to keep track of their inventory. When I went into the military, I wanted something that I could use when I got out. I wasn’t interested in being a mechanic or learning something that might be so specialized that it would be of no use when I got out. Maybe you’ve heard of the degree in underwater basket weaving. It’s one of those jobs that it’s hard to find in the market place. Or maybe a degree in general studies.</p>



<p>It turned out that what I learned about cooking was only a small part of my culinary education. It did, however, lead to most of my international travel but certainly not most of my domestic travel.</p>



<p>Photography is another thing that I would like to do. I’ve been able to take pictures wherever I go, but I’ve never been able to do it professionally. The amount of money that I’ve made over the years likely wouldn’t pay even a month’s worth of rent, now. Yet there are wedding photographers, photojournalists and photographers who make YouTube videos who are able to travel to different parts of the world and make at least enough money to live off of.</p>



<p>One of my friends in Spokane had a business promoting concerts. This job took him over a wide area of the United States, with offices in at least a few states and at least a few hundred employees.</p>



<p>I have another friend who is a doctor. I’m not sure whether or not he travels, but I know that there are doctors who travel on missions trips, often offering free services in areas where medical help may be harder to find. There are even huge ships dedicated to helping people in these areas, all paid for by donations and run mostly by volunteers.</p>



<p>Speaking of volunteering, I knew someone who was planing to go to Hawaii to work on an organic farm. This work was volunteer work, but I guess he had enough money saved up that it wasn’t an issue for him. Some of the students from the culinary school where I attended went to places like New York City to work for top chefs on television programs, not for any money but for the ability to be able to put it on their resume and for the money that they might be able to make later in their careers.</p>



<p>If you can get your own television show, that may allow you to travel. Being in movies might do the same, though more and more movies these days do their travel virtually these days. If you can’t get a studio to pay your way, maybe YouTube or some other form of social media will.</p>



<p>If you can do well enough on Amazon, selling your products online or making money through affiliate marketing, then you should be able to pay your own way. I found one family on YouTube, The Kelley Krew, that was able to take to the road with a family of six, now seven, and spend that year in a large travel RV and truck.</p>



<p>There are other jobs as well that will allow you to travel, whether you are working for someone else or working independently: whether you require $100 thousand or more to get through the year or just a few hundred a month to get by. it’s all up to you. And, of course, local restrictions on travel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Whether you have a job, a business of your own, or just a hobby that helps you pass your time, it’s good to have both a mission and a passion. Mission is simply your reason for doing what you do, while passion is what helps get you out of bed even before you’ve had your coffee or need to go to the bathroom.</p>



<p>You can mission without passion, but it is not likely that you will have passion without a mission. The best case scenario is that you would have a mission, that you have a great deal of passion and that the two are on the same path. The worst case would be that you have neither mission or passion.</p>



<p>The fact is that passion can come and go, as it tends to be built on our feelings. Mission, whatever it is, does not change. My mission is to do whatever I do as unto the Lord, and to bring him glory. It’s not about making myself or anyone else happy. If God puts me somewhere, it’s either because that is where he wants to use me, or because he wants to show me that I need to work on building a different path.</p>



<p>What is your mission, and what gets you going? Maybe it’s a hobby. Maybe you write short stories, or create beautiful songs. Maybe you serve others. Maybe you are still looking for an answer to these questions. There’s certainly noting wrong with that.</p>



<p>One thing that you can do at any age is to write down your goals. Your goals can change over time, but that’s okay. You may find it helpful, as I have, to start off by writing the things that you do not want, and then writing the opposite of that. “I do not want to be poor” becomes “I want to be rich”, and “I don’t want to work for a large corporation might become either “I want to work for a small business” or “I want to start my own business.” Make certain to be specific, and you are more likely to be able to measure your goal if it is both quantifiable and time sensitive.</p>



<p>Once you know what you want to do and you have well defined goals, break down into goals steps that can either be done once and marked off of the to-do list, or can be turned into daily tasks or even into habits. Take care of as many of the things that you can that just need to be done once, but also begin to figure out how you can turn routine items into habits. There may be just one item that you will be doing daily, and it may be something that you enjoy. For other things, it may be a little harder, and you may have to set up a mental cue.</p>



<p>It may take time, but you can set up habits that will take you, not where someone else wants to go, but where you want to go. If you do something because it is something that you want to do, rather than because you have to do it, it is likely that you are going to be more passionate about what you are doing, and it will be less of a struggle to get out of bed. Believe it or not, it’s possible to look forward to waking up at 4 in the morning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There are several ways to start and run an online store these days. It can be run as part of a business, or on it’s own. You can sell one item, or hundreds of items. Below are just a few options that you may use for opening your own online store.</p>



<p>Places to set up shop<br>There are a number of places to set up an online store. You can select one of these or, if you’re more adventurous, you can sell on your own website.</p>



<p>eBay: a well know auction sight. It charges to list each item (some times it offers free listings), and charges a percentage of the final sales prices. Online stores are also available for a fee.</p>



<p>Amazon: is the larges of all online retailers. It also offers online stores, for a fee, or you can sell individual items, also for a fee. One advantage to selling on Amazon is that, if you have a item ready to sell, is that you send your item to them, with the proper labels, and they store, sell it, collecting the money, and ship your item for you through their popular program, Fulfilled by Amazon. The disadvantage is that they take a large portion of the profits.</p>



<p>Etsy: is popular for artists and other creatives. Creating a store is free, and the cost to list each items is low. There is also a fee collected by Etsy for each sale. Etsy doesn’t fulfill orders; it’s the responsibility of the seller to ship items that are sold.</p>



<p>Shopify: is more of a go between between. The way I have mine set up is that I design products on Printify (and online printing shop), who takes a portion of the sales based on their cost and their profit margin. I cannot change their cost, but I can shop around for the best prices. I do set my price, and the percentage that I make. I list my items on Shopify, who charge a monthly fee (with a short free trial period). They also offer a number of apps. I have one for setting up affiliates, which offers free and paid services. I then list my items on my Facebook page, either directly, or as a link to my webpage.</p>



<p>Facebook and Instagram: these can be used as a stand alone marketing strategy. I’ve seen people sell clothing on Instagram, and I’ve seen numerous items advertised on Facebook. Usually these adds take you to their website. There is a fee, and it’s based on a budget that you set, and the number of days that you want to advertise.</p>



<p>Ways to get things to sell<br>Make them: This is a way for people to sell crafts that they make. This is best if you already have something that you can make and enjoy creating. It may not be a good idea if it is an item that is hard to make, takes a lot of time to make, or can’t be sold for enough money to justify making and selling whatever it is that you want to sell.</p>



<p>Buy them: There are several options. One way to get started is just to go to yard sales. If you can find a bargain, you may just be able to sell it on eBay. The better you are at finding unique items, the better you will do. Thrift stores are another option, if you have a good eye at what people are looking for. I heard of a couple that makes a few hundred thousand dollars a year finding deeply discounted health and beauty items and selling them on Amazon.</p>



<p>Websites like Alibaba are also good sources of items to sell online. Usually, these items are made overseas, and it may take an investment of your time and money before you can get started. For best results, you will need to contact and choose at least three companies to work with.</p>



<p>Out of those three companies, you will need to collect samples (which you will have to pay for) and choose the best one. Once this company produces your item, it will have to be shipped to the United States, and that can cost as much as having the items made, itself. Your item can then be sent either to you, or to one of Amazon’s warehouses, where they will take care of selling the item for you; all you have to do is create a listing on your Amazon store that wows buyers. Some sellers have made millions of dollars selling items that they got through Alibaba and sold in an Amazon store, while others have lost a great deal of money.</p>



<p>Print on demand: After looking at several options, I decided to go with Printify (I get no money or any compensation for saying this). For me, they had the best services and offered the best prices on their merchandise. Print on demand, however, cannot match the speed with which Amazon can ship items: often within a day or two. But print on demand eliminates the need to purchase inventory in advance. And for someone who wants to sell something like T-shirts (as I am doing), it eliminates the need to have stock of every color and every size.</p>



<p>There are also several advantages of setting up an online store. If done correctly, these stores can be run automatically, even while you sleep. If you know what your market is looking for, and are connected to “your people”, you are less likely to loose money. It’s so much easier and cost so much less expensive to set up an online store than a traditional “brick and mortar” type store. Also, if everything is done online, it can open up opportunities for travel because, as long as you have a connection to the internet, you can run your online store.</p>
