<p>Is it possible to fail to success? Is it possible to go right by turning left enough times? The answer to both of these is yes. But they leave something unanswered. How many times does one have to turn left to be going to what would have been to the right, and how many times does it take someone to fail before succeeding?</p>



<p>The answer is, it’s different for everyone. Walt Disney is just one example of someone who failed to success, but so is Thomas Edison. It took him about a thousand tries before he came up with the right material to put into the light bulb.</p>



<p>Failure can help point us in the right direction by helping us to see the wrong direction. But success is more than not failing, it’s figuring out what really matters. I could become a successful bank robber, for example, but I know that is not something that I want to do. What I really want to do is to help others and not to hurt them.</p>



<p>One way to shorten the time it takes to succeed is to find a mentor: someone who is or has already done the thing that you or I want to do. So, if you want to sell widgets, find someone who is a successful widget salesperson and ask that person to help you. Some people may offer classes and that is another form of mentorship.</p>



<p>Of course, if you or I aren’t clear on what we want, it’s going to be nearly impossible to know whether or not we’ve found it. So, this is what I would do: put it in writing, and put as much detail as possible. Make a list of things that you want, describing each one in detail — limiting the list to four or five things — and then prioritize them.</p>



<p>I’ve created a business plan that may help. You’ll find it below. Feel free to download it and make as many copies as you like. If you do download it, please let me know if you find it helpful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today is Collector Car Appreciation Day. Try saying that three times fast.<br>It’s not just about old or fancy and unique cars. A while industry has been built around the automobile. Globally, revenue from just the sale of cars, themselves, was about $31.5 billon, with a growth rate of about 8%. That’s a lot of money and outdoes most stocks on the US Stock Exchange.</p>



<p><br>Aside from the cars, there is petrol, oil changes, car washes, hotel stays, advertising fees, photographers and models. It all adds up, and this money goes out to local businesses.<br>My dream car is a Mercedes, convertible from the early 1980s. I will probably never own one, but it’s nice to dream. It would likely be deep blue with brown leather seats.</p>



<p><br>What is your dream car?</p>



<p>For me, it’s more than a dream of having a particular car. I’m more than happy with the car that I have: a 2017 gray Jeep. I’m even happier that I’m no longer driving a 1991 van: ugly in every way.<br>For me, the Jeep reminds me that things can get better, no matter how I may feel at the moment. It’s also a reminder that my God is my source and my provider. And, because of this, I don’t have to worry about tomorrow.</p>



<p>If I begin to worry, as I am prone to do from time to time, I can go from 0 to panicked in .60 seconds. But, if I keep my eyes on God, and His Word in my heart (mind), there is really nothing to fear.</p>



<p><br>How can we celebrate Collector Car Appreciation Day? It may depend on where you live. If, for example, you live in a rural community, it may be that you or your neighbor has one of these in his or her yard. You may be able find a collector car at a local car dealership. You can also find photos and posters online. And there are car magazines. Finally, there are toy, model and remote control cars.<br></p>



<p>Perhaps, just learning something new is what matters. Personally, I would say that hope is what matters. And, it matters where we put on hope. My hope is in God: the Father, Son and Holly Spirit. Where do you find your hope?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>August is home business Month. Home Business Month is a crucial event to celebrate and promote home business and their owners. However, what will make the month memorable for small businesses is if it significantly impacts their sales and income.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Setting a month aside for home businesses is good, but we can be carried away by the event and ignore the businesses. Therefore, we must be intentional about helping businesses that are running from home in a visible and measurable way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are wondering how to support home businesses but have no idea, these are 5 ways you can help promote and grow home businesses around you.</p>



<p>Shop Local</p>



<p>The first step toward supporting home businesses is choosing to shop locally. The impact is more direct, visible and encouraging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of defaulting to big-box retailers or online giants, make a conscious effort to seek out home businesses in your community. Explore online marketplaces, social media platforms, or local directories to discover a wide range of offerings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most small businesses have great quality products and render excellent services. Patronizing them will enable you to contribute to the local economy and create a diverse retail landscape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Explore freelancers, consultants, e-commerce, home-based food businesses, coaching, and home-based childcare to discover hidden gems and support the entrepreneurs who poured their heart and soul into their businesses.</p>



<p>Spread the Word</p>



<p>Marketing is the life of a business; that is why big corporations invest heavily in digital and traditional marketing. However, one of the most potent forms of marketing less talked about is word-of-mouth marketing.</p>



<p>Sharing positive experiences about a product or service to one&#8217;s circle of influence is more effective than coming across that same business online or in a local newspaper. So, utilize Home Business Month to convert your family and friends to customers of local businesses that served you well.</p>



<p>It will particularly help small businesses working with a small marketing budget. Your genuine support and endorsement can attract new customers and boost the visibility of small businesses, helping them thrive and grow.</p>



<p>Engage on Social Media</p>



<p>Most small businesses are on social media. But getting engagements is usually challenging because of a limited social media marketing budget.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, you can drive engagement and make them more visible online by liking their posts or sharing pictures of you patronizing them. Social media endorsement is powerful and can blow up the sales of any small business that goes viral.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Popular social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Tik-Tok have created platforms for local businesses to connect with their customers. Use their hashtags and tag them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember, every business is only one post away from becoming big in today&#8217;s digital world.</p>



<p>Attend Virtual Events</p>



<p>Home businesses often organize virtual events like product launches, workshops, or webinars. Virtual events provide opportunities to learn more about the business, interact with the owner, and potentially make a purchase. Your attendance and active participation demonstrate support and help home businesses thrive.</p>



<p>For example, freelance writers launch book pre-sale campaigns to create a buzz around their new books and increase sales even before the book launch. You can support them by purchasing their books which are mostly sold at a discounted rate, sharing campaign links on your social media pages, inviting people to the book launch, and buying a copy for a friend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most people do not take virtual events seriously because they feel it&#8217;s less impactful. But that used to be in the past. Virtual events are engaging and impactful. Thanks to advanced and simple software that makes interaction, financial transactions, and networking easy virtually.</p>



<p>Leave Reviews</p>



<p>Good reviews are like magnets that attract new customers to home businesses. They are also like the lifeblood that keeps home businesses running. People are skeptical about patronizing home businesses, especially those online, because of past poor experiences, fear of being scammed, and other reasons. However, your positive review can be the prompt someone needs to give a home business a try.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Social media platforms, online marketplaces, and websites create sections for review. If you have an excellent experience, leave a 5-star review stating the value you got.</p>



<p>During this Home Business Month, write a genuine review about home businesses you patronize on review platforms. These reviews serve as testimonials to attract potential customers and increase home business owners&#8217; income.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Home Business Month is not only about marking your calendar and recognizing August as a day set aside for home businesses. Instead, it&#8217;s a platform to support businesses striving beyond all odds to succeed. Therefore, patronize them, and promote them to your network and community to contribute to the diversity and vitality of your local business community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In October 2019, I had the opportunity to publish an article on COL1972, a clothing company in Pennsylvania that, in 2019 was less than a year old. Col stands for Culture Of Life and the year 1972 is the year when abortion became legal in the United States of America. COL1972 uses part of its profits to support mothers who decide against abortion but need financial or other help with their pregnancy.</p>



<p>“The supreme court ruled that our tiniest Americans could be denied the right to life,” said Carla D’Addesi, in our first interview. “Since 1973, 60 million American children have been denied the right to life,” continued D’Addesi. “We hope to return to a culture of life and that year 1972, which symbolizes when all life mattered.”<br>COL1972 still sells women’s clothing, men’s clothing, and jewelry through their online store. The clothing and jewelry are designed by D’Addesi and her three daughters. The original LLGT website was closed but returned in October of 2022. Recently, I contacted D’Addesi to see if she would do another interview and she agreed.<br>“My daughters and I created the name COL1972, “ said D’Addesi. “It is a great conversational piece; people ask all the time what does COL 1972 mean. This gives us the opportunity to share that 1972 was the last year we enjoyed a culture of life in the United States of America.”<br>In 2019, COL1972 D’Addesi was running the business with the help of her three daughters. “My husband (my daughters dad) helps on occasion. We have a fulfillment center that packaged and ships all our items. We have a web designer. But my daughters and I do all the marketing and designing of our brand on a mission.” Now, COL1972, after a few years of slow and steady growth has been able to add two part-time employees.<br>“My three daughters still work for the company although my oldest is now a first year law student and our middle daughter is a second year nursing student, my baby who is now a senior in high school is enjoying Liberty University online Academy, and is really a huge help to Culture Of Life 1972.”</p>



<p>In the,October 2019 interview, D’Addesi said that she and her daughters came up with the name for business. &nbsp;I asked D’Addesi if she had considered changing the name of her business since the overturn of Roe V. Wade. “We considered changing the name of our business after June 24, 2022 decision, however we decided to just incorporate some 2022 styles and jewelry items. Our life tribe is wearing the 1972 and 2022 pieces together it really shares a wonderful story about the culture of life and our country.”</p>



<p>“After much discussion in prayer we decided to keep 1972 and incorporate 2022 as the year 1972 is still a historical moment for the culture of life tribe. Our country had 50 dark years between 1972-2022. May we strive to win a culture of life in all 50 States today.”</p>



<p>D’Addesi says that her customer tends to be “conservative stylish woman who wants USA made products that giveback to life. We have business casual, bump-friendly for our moms and comfy clothes for our homeschoolers.”<br>When asked what she might have done differently, D’Addes said, “I would not have wasted money in a business consultant. I learned that I can learn everything that I need for my online boutique on YouTube. I would not have wasted money advertising in fancy Christian Magazines. Posting for free on all our social media got more sales and growth than paying for fancy ads.”<br>What advice would D’Addesi give to anyone wanting to start a similar business? “Pray about your new business and speak to others that have a successful business that you desire to have. Successful business owners advice is priceless. They are always willing to share with someone who desires to learn. Be patient! 2023 is our 5th year in business. We just finished our 4th year. Be patient! Businesses take time. Don’t believe a person who tells you that you should be hitting these numbers or have this many followers by year one. Slow and steady wins the race!”</p>



<p>D’Addesi compares her customers to family, saying, “We get thank you notes often. They also share their dreams and fears with us. We love them and we hope we have earned their respect and love. Even if you never purchase with us again, we are praying for you and we ask you keep us in your prayers.”<br>“I was asked to speak about COL1972 at Liberty University Convocation in February 2020,” said D’Addesi. “This is the largest gathering of Christians weekly. I was honored to speak to 15,000 students live and was streamed live to 1 million viewers. &nbsp;Liberty invited us to do a fashion show for 500 students the following day. This opened the door for other similar events.”</p>



<p>COL1972 gives majority of our 10% back to life turning point in Philadelphia and Blue Ridge Pregnancy Center in Lynchburg, Va. in previous years we have divided our fun — sometimes to over 50 pregnancy centers and pro-life causes.”</p>



<p>D’Addesi says that she is very involved with her church. “We enjoy a small group each Sunday evening.” D’Addesi also enjoys tennis and skiing as a family. “Our extended family all live in our state so I am very busy with nieces and nephews activities as well. Faith, family and you can also say fashion is everything to me.”</p>



<p>“My daughters had a brilliant idea to purchase a Jeep that they had wrapped pink cheetah with our logo,” said D’Addesi. “We needed something to transport inventory for pop-up shops and fashion shows. It brings a smile to people’s faces even those who don’t know who we are. God thing.”</p>

<p>I used to wonder if an someone could build a group of businesses that work together to support a ministry that helps the homeless — and do so without having to ask for donations. I used to wonder if I could structure such a business. I wonder a lot of things, and like all of the others, it hasn’t happened yet.</p>



<p>There is, it seems, a county, somewhere, that is doing something similar. I’m pretty sure it’s too much for one person to do. Yet, there are business that are helping others while they (hopefully) make a profit. They aren’t asking for donations. Still, they are able to help others.</p>



<p>One such organization is COL1972, who gives part of its profits to help expectant mothers. They help save lives. You can read more about COL1972 in the <a href="https://llgt.cafe/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/April-2023-issue-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April 2023 edition</a> of LLGT Cafe.</p>



<p>Tom’s Shoes has long been dedicated to producing quality shoes. Their commitment is to donate one pair of shoos for every pair of shoes purchased. Tom’s is also investing in their local community and, according to their website, they have helped over a million individuals since 2006.</p>



<p>Tacos 4 Life has a similar strategy. For every meal that is purchased, they are able to provide one meal through another organization.</p>



<p>I heard of one restaurant that gave customers the opportunity to pay it forward by purchasing slices of pizza for others. A customer could buy a ticket and that ticket would be placed on a bulletin board for anyone who could not afford to buy their own pizza.</p>



<p>We don’t have to own a business to do good. There are countless charities that we can donate to. We can choose to support expedient mothers, we can help organizations like the Arbor Day Foundation, we can help children through <a href="https://www.compassion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Compassion International</a>, or we can hand $20 to the cashier at Starbucks to pay it forward for the next customer that comes along.</p>



<p>One thing is clear. Life can be hard. Some times we need help and we shouldn’t have to go at it alone.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve heard a lot of things about the traveling salesman: from stories of why one failed where another found success to jokes that I cannot repeat. I remember one story of a traveling vacuum cleaner salesman. After dumping a pile of dirt on a woman’s living room floor and said that, if his vacuum cleaner didn’t pick up all of the dirt that he would eat the dirt himself.<br>The story ends with the woman telling him to enjoy his meal because she had no electricity in her home.</p>



<p>My grandfather was a traveling salesman of sorts. Representing FTD in several states, he was able to visit large a large portion of the United States, going around and taking large orders from florists. Not only was he able to travel and to write off his travel expenses, but he was able to afford a nice home in New Orleans as well as many other things.</p>



<p>The idea of the traveling salesman isn’t new. It had been around for a long time. But, perhaps more than the invention of the automobile, the airplane, or the telephone, one thing has changed the role of the traveling salesman. That one thing is the computer.</p>



<p>You see, my grandfather probably wouldn’t be able to do what he did all those years ago in today’s world. For one thing, many of the smaller florists have gone out of business. Most flours are now sold in large grocery chains. And orders are placed on computers.</p>



<p>At the same time, the computer has opened up new markets. Instead of going door to door, seeing is done computer to computer over the internet. And the items that are being sold no longer have to be a physical object but may very well be a digital item, like a picture, an ebook, a song or a piece of software.</p>



<p>I’ll never forget the punch cards that my dad would have produced to create just one software program, or the fact that these cards would have to be redone if there was as little as one mistake in the code. I remember the funny noise that the modem made when first connecting one computer to another by phone, before the internet existed.</p>



<p>It wasn’t right away that the computer changed things. The first computers were as big as a bus and had hardly any memory at all. It took computers that could go into the homes of enough people, the software to operate these complex machines, high speed communication through the internet and the resources to buy these gadgets. The laptop needed batteries small enough and powerful enough to be able to take the computer anywhere, and the invention of the smartphone and tablet made the computer even more mobile and accessible.</p>



<p>Today, if we choose, we can work from just about anywhere we want. Though many parts of the world still have little or no internet access, these areas are shrinking and may one day disappear. And, while the number of opportunities have opened up immensely, so has the level of competition. So, as with everyone in life, the prize goes to the one who works the hardest and refuses to quit, no matter what: male or female.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Whether you have a job, a business of your own, or just a hobby that helps you pass your time, it’s good to have both a mission and a passion. Mission is simply your reason for doing what you do, while passion is what helps get you out of bed even before you’ve had your coffee or need to go to the bathroom.</p>



<p>You can mission without passion, but it is not likely that you will have passion without a mission. The best case scenario is that you would have a mission, that you have a great deal of passion and that the two are on the same path. The worst case would be that you have neither mission or passion.</p>



<p>The fact is that passion can come and go, as it tends to be built on our feelings. Mission, whatever it is, does not change. My mission is to do whatever I do as unto the Lord, and to bring him glory. It’s not about making myself or anyone else happy. If God puts me somewhere, it’s either because that is where he wants to use me, or because he wants to show me that I need to work on building a different path.</p>



<p>What is your mission, and what gets you going? Maybe it’s a hobby. Maybe you write short stories, or create beautiful songs. Maybe you serve others. Maybe you are still looking for an answer to these questions. There’s certainly noting wrong with that.</p>



<p>One thing that you can do at any age is to write down your goals. Your goals can change over time, but that’s okay. You may find it helpful, as I have, to start off by writing the things that you do not want, and then writing the opposite of that. “I do not want to be poor” becomes “I want to be rich”, and “I don’t want to work for a large corporation might become either “I want to work for a small business” or “I want to start my own business.” Make certain to be specific, and you are more likely to be able to measure your goal if it is both quantifiable and time sensitive.</p>



<p>Once you know what you want to do and you have well defined goals, break down into goals steps that can either be done once and marked off of the to-do list, or can be turned into daily tasks or even into habits. Take care of as many of the things that you can that just need to be done once, but also begin to figure out how you can turn routine items into habits. There may be just one item that you will be doing daily, and it may be something that you enjoy. For other things, it may be a little harder, and you may have to set up a mental cue.</p>



<p>It may take time, but you can set up habits that will take you, not where someone else wants to go, but where you want to go. If you do something because it is something that you want to do, rather than because you have to do it, it is likely that you are going to be more passionate about what you are doing, and it will be less of a struggle to get out of bed. Believe it or not, it’s possible to look forward to waking up at 4 in the morning.</p>

<p>Type in “business” and do a search on Google, and you’ll come up with about 15,930,000,000 results.</p>



<p>Business is a web of individuals including the person who turns a dream into reality, the people who help finance this dream, all of the suppliers who supply things from parts to packing materials, the workers who make products, the customers who buy these products, and all of the people who are affected by the use of this product. And it all just seems to work.</p>



<p>It works for those who go after their dream. It works for those who know what they want and do what they love. It works for those who keep track of every little detail, and don’t let anything go unchecked.</p>



<p>It works for those who build a name and a reputation along with a quality product. It works for those who build strong relationships with suppliers. It works for those who understand the needs of their customers and communicates with their customers how they stand out from the crowd.</p>



<p>Business is about the business schools, those who try and fail, those who learn and teach others from what they learned, and those who jump on the story when a company fails, and those who are affected, whether a company succeeds or fails.</p>



<p>Businesses affect works, families, investors, schools, churches, customers and other businesses. Businesses that work and grow bring money to a community: they bring life communities.&nbsp; Business that fail, steal, or fail to use resources properly take away from their communities.</p>



<p>It works for countless businesses who are willing to make the changes necessary to stay around. It worked for Wells Fargo, who started out with the Pony Express. It worked for Coca-Cola who took advantage of the mistake of New Coke. It didn’t work for countless retail store, factories and online businesses who failed to adapt.</p>



<p>Business works though cooperation, whether it employs one or thousands. Businesses are torn apart, not by competition, but by a failure to adapt. Their torn apart from within by those who start or spread rumors. They are torn apart by those who loose sight of the vision of why they are there to begin with.</p>



<p>Perhaps, worse than a business that fails is a business that dies as a dream with the one who dreamed it.</p>

<p>So, you want to start a business. Great. There can many benefits to running a business, from making extra money to doing something that you enjoy — along with offering a product or service that can help others.</p>



<p>I’m not going into all of the details of starting a business, but you will find a list of at least some of the questions that you may need to answer before starting a business. And, if you’re like me, many of these answers will change over time.</p>



<p>Are you offering a product or service (or both)?</p>



<p>Who are your intended customers?</p>



<p>How will you reach your customers?</p>



<p>How will you reach new customers?</p>



<p>Who is your competition?</p>



<p>How are you unique compared to others who are offering the same product or service?</p>



<p>Do you need to go to pay for schooling to learn your trade?</p>



<p>Are there ways, other than school that can help your learn your trade?</p>



<p>How much time and money are you willing to spend reaching new customers?</p>



<p>Will you be keeping your “day job”, or are is this going to be your only source of income?</p>



<p>If this is going to be your only income, are there ways that you can bring in money quickly?</p>



<p>What resources do you have: time, money, friends who can help, skills that others need and such?</p>



<p>Do you need a license for your business?</p>



<p>Do you need insurance for your business?</p>



<p>Do you need a business account to keep your business earnings separate from your other money?</p>



<p>What will you name your business?</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Do you need an assumed business name, or “doing business as” papers, which are filed with local your local government?</p>



<p>Do you need an earned income number (EIN) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)?</p>



<p>Do you need a sales tax number for collecting sales tax?</p>



<p>Will you need to borrow money to get started</p>



<p>Do you have a business plan?</p>



<p>Do you need a business plan?</p>



<p>Will you be sole proprietor, a partnership, a limited liability company (LLC) or some other form of business?</p>



<p>Do you know people who are already interested in your product and/or service?</p>



<p>Will your your intended customers be able to afford what you are selling?</p>



<p>What are your own financial needs?</p>



<p>Do I need to pay for someone to help with taxes for legal advice?</p>



<p>How are you spending most of your time?</p>



<p>Who are you spending most of your time with?</p>



<p>What changes might you need to make in your life?</p>



<p>There are probably other questions that you can ask yourself, but this is a good place to start, as these may be things that you haven’t yet thought about. There are so many books on starting a business: books listing 101 ideas for a home based business to how to write a business plan, morning meditations for the entrepreneur and so on.</p>



<p>Be aware that it is probably going to take more time, money and/or energy than you realize to get started. My advise: know yourself. You have to know that you have a product or service that is worth buying and that there are customers who want and are willing to spend their money on what you have to offer. It’s up to you to find those customers.</p>
