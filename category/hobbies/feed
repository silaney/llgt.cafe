<p>August is American Artist Appreciation Month. Do you have any favorite artists? I do. But I must say that some of my favorite artist are from Canada. Sarah McLachlan, Marie-Louise Gay and Ann Marie McDonald are just a few. But I really like the work of David Burnett, an American Photographer known for photographing subjects from presidents to Olympians. Here are a few more of my favorite (and some other well known) American artists.</p>



<p>Norman Rockwell, born February 3, 1894 in New York City, died November 8, 1978 in Stockbridge, MA at the age of 84. Rockwell was best known for his painting and illustrations depicting American life, especially for his work for The Saturday Evening Post.</p>



<p>Georgia O’Keefe, born November 15, 1887 in Sun Prairie, WI and died March 6, 1986 in Santa Fe, NM. Her work was primarily American modern, now graces some of the world’s greatest art collections.</p>



<p>Jacob Lawrence was born September 7, 1917 in Atlantic City, NY and died June 9 2000 in Seattle, WA. Calling his work “dynamic cubism”, Lawrence was best known for his depictions of African-American history.</p>



<p>These are just a few artists. My favorite art forms — the things that I do best, include writing, cooking and photography. These are things that I enjoy doing for myself and for others to (perhaps) enjoy.</p>



<p>What form of art do you enjoy and who are your favorite artists? Please comment below. Thanks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As an introvert, I understand what it’s like to try to make new friends. It can be really hard to meet new people. It can seem, at times, nearly impossible, especially when it seems that everyone is so busy, even if they are just checking their social media account(s). But there is hope.</p>



<p>If you can, put yourself in a social setting. Attend a conference, take a bus somewhere, go shopping or go for a walk in a place where you feel safe — like a mall.</p>



<p>It may take time, but find someone who looks familiar. Try to start a conversation. If it turns into a friendship, great, if not, maybe it will, later. Whether you are an introvert or not, friendships take time.</p>



<p>Introduce yourself and try to remember the other person’s name. Try to make the other person feel comfortable. Remember that the other person may or may not remember your name the next time — or even at the end of the conversation. Remind them of your name, or ask them to remind you of their name.</p>



<p>Humor works. I went up to someone in a store and said that I would dance with them to the music, but I wouldn’t want to embrace them. Even if you don’t immediately have a new friend with whom you can share your deepest secrets, at least you can share your smile with someone.</p>



<p>Finally, look for others who may share your interest. I attended a church where the men were more interested in talking about tractors than other subjects: not interested. Don’t look for people interested in talking about stamp collecting at a supermarket. Instead, join a stamp collecting club.</p>



<p>Yes, it can be hard to meet new people, but it’s not impossible. Try this: cover your mouth and say “impossible”. Now, take your hand and wad up the word before throwing up the word. There, you’ve just taken the word out of your vocabulary. Better yet, give it to God, for nothing is impossible for God.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today is Collector Car Appreciation Day. Try saying that three times fast.<br>It’s not just about old or fancy and unique cars. A while industry has been built around the automobile. Globally, revenue from just the sale of cars, themselves, was about $31.5 billon, with a growth rate of about 8%. That’s a lot of money and outdoes most stocks on the US Stock Exchange.</p>



<p><br>Aside from the cars, there is petrol, oil changes, car washes, hotel stays, advertising fees, photographers and models. It all adds up, and this money goes out to local businesses.<br>My dream car is a Mercedes, convertible from the early 1980s. I will probably never own one, but it’s nice to dream. It would likely be deep blue with brown leather seats.</p>



<p><br>What is your dream car?</p>



<p>For me, it’s more than a dream of having a particular car. I’m more than happy with the car that I have: a 2017 gray Jeep. I’m even happier that I’m no longer driving a 1991 van: ugly in every way.<br>For me, the Jeep reminds me that things can get better, no matter how I may feel at the moment. It’s also a reminder that my God is my source and my provider. And, because of this, I don’t have to worry about tomorrow.</p>



<p>If I begin to worry, as I am prone to do from time to time, I can go from 0 to panicked in .60 seconds. But, if I keep my eyes on God, and His Word in my heart (mind), there is really nothing to fear.</p>



<p><br>How can we celebrate Collector Car Appreciation Day? It may depend on where you live. If, for example, you live in a rural community, it may be that you or your neighbor has one of these in his or her yard. You may be able find a collector car at a local car dealership. You can also find photos and posters online. And there are car magazines. Finally, there are toy, model and remote control cars.<br></p>



<p>Perhaps, just learning something new is what matters. Personally, I would say that hope is what matters. And, it matters where we put on hope. My hope is in God: the Father, Son and Holly Spirit. Where do you find your hope?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>June 29 is National Camera Day. You can celebrate by buying shopping for or buying a new camera, buying a tripod or flash, or by taking pictures with whatever camera you have.</p>



<p>The camera has changed so much from the first cameras to today’s cameras. And the pictures that have been taken not only enrich our lives, recording moments of history, but have been used to shape our world.</p>



<p>Below are some tips for taking better pictures. Keep these some of these ideas in mind next time you take pictures.</p>



<p><strong>Keep it Simple</strong><br>Don’t over complicate an image by trying to include too many subjects.</p>



<p><strong>Fill the Frame</strong><br>Try to make sure that everything that is in the image belongs in the image.</p>



<p><strong>Rule of thirds</strong><br>The idea of the rule of thirds is to keep the subject out of the center of your image. Imagine placing a tic-tac-toe over your image. Try to place the main subject of your image where these imaginary lines intersect. Some cameras will place these lines on your screen for you, making it easier to follow this rule. Remember, however, that thought it is called a rule, it really is just a suggestion.</p>



<p><strong>Lead the Viewer’s Eye</strong><br>A good image should direct the viewer’s eye to the subject, and all of the elements of a photograph should contribute to the subject, as well as, point to that subject. Anything else may just be a distraction.</p>



<p><strong>Balance</strong><br>Balance refers an equality in size and/or weight of the elements in a photograph.</p>



<p><strong>Other Elements</strong><br>There are other elements that help make a good image, but they may not be present in every photograph.</p>



<p><strong>Lines</strong><br>Lines that are parallel, are “S” curved, or lead to the subject work best. A photograph may have one set of lines, or many.</p>



<p><strong>Patterns</strong><br>A patterns refers to elements that repeat, or at least seem to repeat, or elements that compliment each other. A pattern may or be a pattern of lines, shapes or or colors.</p>



<p><strong>Shapes</strong><br>Shapes should compliment the subject. Shapes usually refer to squares, triangles, rectangles, circles ad ovals. A square or rectangle, for example, may be used to frame the subject. Also, shapes may or may not be clearly defined, as in the visual triangle formed when three people are photographed looking at each other.</p>



<p><strong>Texture</strong><br>Texture in photography usually refers to an object with a rough surface. Such a surface, with the right lighting, can provide a high level of contract.</p>



<p><strong>Space to Move</strong><br>When photographing something associated with movement, this means giving the object space ahead of it. If it is a person, looking off into the distance, it means having the person look into the open space in the picture instead of at the edge of the picture.</p>



<p><strong>Point of View</strong><br>Point of view refers to the angle that the picture is taken from. Often, it’s not possible to climb up on a ladder or onto the top of a building, but it may be possible to stoop down to get a lower angle.</p>



<p><strong>Color</strong><br>Color can be a very important element of a photograph, and even a black and white image may have an element of color but, as with other elements, colors should compliment the subject, and not clash with or overcome the subject.</p>



<p><strong>Timing</strong><br>One other aspect of photography is timing. Timing could be a matter of capturing the image at just the right moment, such as a baseball hitting a bat, or waiting for just the right light. Timing is a skill that comes with practice and, sometimes, it’s just a matter of being at the right place at the right time.</p>



<p>Finally, photography, like other forms of art has the ability to transform our lives. It not only boost our income but it can boost our energy level as well as the “feel good” hormones in our brain. Trust me — and the several doctors/psychologist who have proven it.</p>



<p>Don’t be afraid to take a lot of pictures. Try different angles, and taking pictures at different times of day. Then you can go back and find out what pictures you like most. Above all, have fun.</p>

<p>How much is enough? It’s a simple question, right? Last night, I got about four hours sleep. I got to bed late and woke up early. For a few, this might be enough sleep. For me, it’s not. Fortunately, I did get a little more sleep after going to an appointment that I had, but it still doesn’t seem like enough.</p>



<p>But there are less needed things that make it harder to know when enough is enough. For example, I got another lens for my camera last week. It wasn’t all that expensive compared to most of the lenses that Canon sells and it fills a “need” that my other lenses don’t. But it’s not a need, it’s a want.</p>



<p>Similarly, there is a mixer on display at Sam’s Club that looks so nice. But it’s not a need or a want, at least not now. And I don’t have room for it in my kitchen. Really the list of things could go on.</p>



<p>Conversely, there are things that I have in my life from time to time that I would rather not have: frustration, irritation and loneliness, just to name a few. These are just some of the things that I would rather not deal with.</p>



<p>Did you know that, according to the Bible, it’s the latter things — the loneliness and frustrations — that draw us closer to or make us more like God? I know it, but it’s easy to forget, especially when we’re “suffering” these things.</p>



<p>So, what are we to do? For the first, it’s best to have a budget. It needs to be one that we can stick with, and it should be as close to our actual needs as possible. I say this because things like groceries can be hard to predict, unless we really work hard at planning both the budget and our diet.</p>



<p>For the other things, we can learn to deal with them. Breathing exercises — taking a long breath in through the nose, holding it for a few seconds and a long breath out the mouth can help. Just counting slowly to ten can also help.</p>



<p>You see, most of our life depends on how we see it. If we see getting a parking ticket as a bad thing, it becomes a bad thing. But if we are able to see it as building patients, it can become a positive thing; that is, if we want to be more patient. For now, I think there might be enough time for another nap.</p>

<p>Observed the last Monday of May and first known as Dedication Day, Memorial Day was established in 1868 to honor Union Soldiers who had died in the American Civil War. Now, it not only honors those Union soldiers, but all US soldiers who have died in armed conflict.</p>



<p>The holiday is celebrated both nationally and on the state level by decorating graves. Many individuals place flowers or wreaths on the graves of loved ones who they have lost. At the federal level, special recognition is given at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. There’s also a National Memorial Day Concert, which airs on PBS.</p>



<p>Ecclesiastes 3:1-4 (KJV) tells us that, “To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven: A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance.”</p>



<p>As a nation, this is our time to morn, and to remember the sacrifice that many have made for the sake of their country.</p>

<p>Is there something keeping you from learning? Perhaps you think you’re not smart enough. Or maybe you think that you’re too old to try something new. Maybe you just don’t know what you might be interested in or what you might like to learn next.</p>



<p>Note that I didn’t mention that you may not know what you might be good at. There are very few things that any of us are good at the very first time we try and, for the majority of us, it takes a lot of practice before anyone outside of our own immediate family will tell us we’re good at something.</p>



<p>I have, for example, worked on my writing for years — mostly in private journals and such. Likewise, I spent years refining my cooking skills. And as far as my photography, it has taken me most of my lifetime to get close to as good as I thought I was when I first picked up a camera. There will always be the critic that will let us know that we aren’t as good at somethings as we think we are. Yet, there are few who will let us know that we can and will get better at whatever we work at.</p>



<p>Not smart enough? Says who? Albert Einstein was not the top student in his early years. Walt Disney failed at least twice before opening Disney. And Steve Jobs was fired from his job at Apple. You may have to adapt your method of learning in order to study a subject, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that you can’t learn.</p>



<p>I’ll never make it on to a professional football/baseball/hockey team, but that doesn’t mean that I cannot throw a ball. The problem isn’t that we’re not good enough. More likely than not, as we get older, we began to compare our work to the work of others, and if our work doesn’t measure up to the work of others, we may get discouraged and give up. Yet, we often fail to take into consideration the time and effort that someone else may have put into doing something, like bounding a ball and putting it though a hoop.</p>



<p>Too old? There are far too many stories — told and untold — of those who began something new or finished something that they started long before, even in their latter years. Likely, however, there are just as many stories of those who gave up while they were still in their youth. Yet, I believe that we are never too old to learn something new.</p>



<p>Maybe you just don’t know where to start. You can look at what you are already doing and go from there. You may also do some research to find out what is being taught in your area or find someone who is willing to teach you what he or she already knows. And, just as we are not as good as we could be at something when we first start, we may not know how enjoyable something might be until we have done it for a while. I, for example, hated typing class. I wasn’t any good at it, and my teacher and I couldn’t seem to see eye to eye. Now, I do much more typing than I do writing by hand. And I kind of enjoy it. It’s the same with the work I now do. I hated some of the lines that I worked on — until I began to get better at it.</p>



<p>Can we do everything? Certainly not. But I believe that most of us can do far more than we ever imagined. At least that’s what experience has taught me.</p>

<p>I saw a video where a car seemed to explode on a California freeway. It wasn’t until I saw the snort video a second time that I realized that a truck had lost its front tire, which was almost immediately run over by a much smaller car, causing it to begin falling apart as it short into the air.</p>



<p>I’m sure that we’ve all had bad days, and I’m sure that the driver of the small car had a bad day, assuming he or she survived the incident. I know that I’ve had my share of bad days.</p>



<p>Today, we celebrate what seems like the worst of bad days. A man had been falsely accused and, knowing that he is going to die, sweats drops of blood. Before his execution is beaten till he is nearly dead and then the exception beings. No, it’s not a bullet that takes his life. It’s not a lethal injection or a surge of electricity. It was a slow death by nails and a cross.</p>



<p>What we celebrate on Good Friday is the suffering of Jesus — as he offered his life, a sacrifice for our sins. Jesus had committed no crime. It was true, he had said that he was equal with God, but it isn’t a lie to tell the truth. Jesus was both man and God. If he weren’t, he could not offer his life to redeem us from our sins. But he was so he could. All I have to do is believe. In fact, there is nothing else I can do. I had a sin debt and, as the song goes, “Jesus paid it all.”</p>



<p>Whatever you celebrate this weekend, however you celebrate, please remember that it was on Good Friday that the Savior of the world hung on a cross and died — taking the punishment that we deserved — so that we might have eternal life. It was out of love for us that he willingly gave his life.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things that we can learn. If there is something that we do on a regular basis, assuming that it’s not something we do for work, it may be a habit. There are bad habits, and they can be hard to break but there are also habits that can be good to have.</p>



<p>Bing organized is one good habit. Being organized means not spending too much time going over and over the same things. It means having a place for everything and putting everything in it’s place. It also means not hanging onto “trash” or the things that are no longer useful, and recognizing what is still needed and what is not. It means making the best use of ones time, energy and resources. Lists may help and organizers may also help but these tools won’t help everyone.</p>



<p>Getting exercise on a regular basis and making healthy choices when it comes to eating are both good habits that we could all work on. It’s not always easy. There may be circumstances where it’s hard to get out and walk or make it to the gym, and it may be difficult to find time to prepare a healthy meal, but unhealthy choices should be the exception rather than the norm.</p>



<p>Just trying to have a positive attitude is one habit that we could all have. Yes, there is a lot of negative in the world but it’s easier to find what we spend our time thinking about. If we spend our time thinking about the things that we don’t have, we are likely to find more lack. If we focus not the things that we do have, and are intentionally thankful for what we do have, that is likely what we will find more of.</p>



<p>It’s good to stay busy. I understand the benefits of having things to do to help pass time. But there are also benefits to just doing nothing. It helps us to unwind, and allows us to be more creative. It allows the body to get the rest it needs and, if we focus on the right things, mentally, we may find that we are able to think more clearly and get more done when we do need to work.</p>



<p>Learning can also be an intentional habit. There are so many things that we can learn that can keep us stronger mentally or help in other ways. Some people learn a new word every day. Others memorize Bible verses or poems. Some people are able to learn a foreign language. Other people are able to make more money by going back to school and learning a new skill or adding to a skill base that they already have. In some career fields, if you don’t keep up with the latest technology, you’re falling behind the crowd.</p>



<p>Finally, people skills are good skills to learn. Just listening, really listening and trying harder to understand than to be understood is one skill that can help throughout ones life. It’s also a skill that, seemingly, is never ever perfected.</p>



<p>Want to learn a new habit? Start small. Leave notes for yourself if it helps, and remember to reward yourself for “small” accomplishments. A pat on the back or a “Yeah me” can actually go a lot further than we realize in helping us start a new habit.</p>



<p>Maybe there’s a habit that you would like to start working on, either improving or adding entirely. There might be several, but it’s probably best to work on just one or two at a time. Perhaps there’s one that I missed that you would like to add to the list. Don’t be shy; we would love to hear from you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’m not exactly sure how old I was when I took my first photograph. I know that my dad had a camera and took pictures of the family as well as for work. I also know that some time around 1980, my mom took a photograph class at the university and that’s about the time I became interested in taking pictures.</p>



<p>A lot has changed over the years in the area of photography. For example, it seems that just about everyone has access to a camera these days. They’re on phones and security devices, drones and computers. When I started taking pictures, it wasn’t that way. There were no digital cameras and, if there were, they weren’t available to the general public. There were fewer photographers, especially in photography’s early years and even fewer who stood out for the work they did. Now, it seems that we’re all photographers and, it would seem, that it is even harder to stand out among other photographers.</p>



<p>Photography has always been fairly expensive. Companies like Eastman Kodak made it easier for families to own cameras in 1888 with the introduction of the Kodak. The Brownie was another film camera. Now, there are actually more camera companies, and a lot more cameras and camera types to choose from. And, though there isn’t the price of film and developing to keep in mind, but there is the price of the price of the camera, itself, memory cards, batteries and anything else that you care to add. Oh, and the first digital cameras — the first DSLRs — they had a price tag of about $5,000.</p>



<p>The quality of cameras and the photographs that they take has changed over the years. The first cameras were actually boxes with just a hole for a lens. An artist had to draw or paint the image. Film was later introduced and now we have film and digital. And the quality of both has greatly increased over time. That DSLR that cost $5,000 would have hardly produced a picture any larger than a post card. And it wasn’t until around the year 2000 that digital cameras even came close to producing the quality of images that a film camera could do. Now, we can do things with digital cameras that one could hardly imagine doing with film.</p>



<p>When I started taking pictures, I also learned how to develop black and white film and prints. I had access to a darkroom and supplies and I could spend hours working on just a few images. It was by no means, instant and color film could take a week or more to get back for a photo lab. With film, with the exception of instant cameras, there was no way to check the quality of your pictures until you developed the film or had someone else develop it. Now, we just have to look at the back of our camera or on our smart phone. We can even have a camera set up remotely and check the images on a smart device.</p>



<p>Laws have changed somewhat over the years. It’s still legal to photograph others in public. But it’s harder, in some cases to use these pictures. Rules of courtesy haven’t changed. Rules of composition and what makes a “good” photograph still hasn’t changed. And everyone is a great photographer until he or she begins comparing their work to the work of other, more experienced, photographers.</p>



<p>There are more ways to make money as a photographer, now, but there is also more competition. A single photographer can produce hundreds of thousands of images and sell them online, yet there there is still a need to fill photography gaps. Anyone can photograph a wedding, but only one photographer may have the style that suits a particular customer’s needs. It takes time and effort to get into photography as a career these days. It takes time to develop one’s style and to make significant improvement in image quality. Then it takes time for others to get to know and appreciate your work. And, if you want to make big bucks, you have to find clients with the needs and the resources to pay that money.</p>



<p>I still own a film camera — a Minox —but I don’t really use it. The last pictures I took were black and white and, without access to a dark room, these pictures took at least 2 weeks to get back. Also, when I got the pictures back, they were badly underexposed. I don’t know, but it was a fairly recent purchase and I think there is a problem with the light meter. I have a really nice camera, now. It’s the nicest camera I’ve ever had. But, these days, I get most of my pictures with my phone.</p>
