<p>Today is World Photo Day, which has been observed annually since 2010. The world’s first photograph was taken with a camera in 1826 by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce. Today, photographers are encouraged to share at least one photo on social media in honor of World Photo Day. It is to be a photo that depicts their world.</p>



<p>Below are some of my favorite pictures that I’ve taken over the years. I hope you enjoy them and remember to share your photos as well. Have a happy World Photo Day.</p>

<p>I’ve picked up several different art supplies over the years, thinking that I would be able to use them for one thing or another.</p>



<p>I picked up clay, thinking I would come up with all sorts of wonderful creations. I even imagined me making an elephant but my creations never got beyond the imagination stage.</p>



<p>I got pencils, colored pencils and pencils that are watercolors. I even got a fancy coloring book, but I’ve hardly used any of them.</p>



<p>I got watercolors and I’ve not used them at all. It’s not that I don’t enjoy watercolors or know how to use them. I do know how to use them. It just seems that I haven’t found the occasion to use them.</p>



<p>I’ve even picked up several art pads and notebooks. One of them has been making a handy pad for my phone. But most of the art pads sit in a stack, unused and hardly touched.</p>



<p>There is one arts and craft item that I have been enjoying, and it is the least expensive of all: that is Play-Doh. I really like the texture and the smell. I don’t have to make anything special out of it and, when I’m done, I can put it right back in it’s container.</p>



<p>Sometimes, the best art supplies aren’t the fanciest or the most expensive. They say that the best camera is the one that you carry around with you. And I find Play-Doh works for me. What craft or crafts do you enjoy most? Please comment below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today is Collector Car Appreciation Day. Try saying that three times fast.<br>It’s not just about old or fancy and unique cars. A while industry has been built around the automobile. Globally, revenue from just the sale of cars, themselves, was about $31.5 billon, with a growth rate of about 8%. That’s a lot of money and outdoes most stocks on the US Stock Exchange.</p>



<p><br>Aside from the cars, there is petrol, oil changes, car washes, hotel stays, advertising fees, photographers and models. It all adds up, and this money goes out to local businesses.<br>My dream car is a Mercedes, convertible from the early 1980s. I will probably never own one, but it’s nice to dream. It would likely be deep blue with brown leather seats.</p>



<p><br>What is your dream car?</p>



<p>For me, it’s more than a dream of having a particular car. I’m more than happy with the car that I have: a 2017 gray Jeep. I’m even happier that I’m no longer driving a 1991 van: ugly in every way.<br>For me, the Jeep reminds me that things can get better, no matter how I may feel at the moment. It’s also a reminder that my God is my source and my provider. And, because of this, I don’t have to worry about tomorrow.</p>



<p>If I begin to worry, as I am prone to do from time to time, I can go from 0 to panicked in .60 seconds. But, if I keep my eyes on God, and His Word in my heart (mind), there is really nothing to fear.</p>



<p><br>How can we celebrate Collector Car Appreciation Day? It may depend on where you live. If, for example, you live in a rural community, it may be that you or your neighbor has one of these in his or her yard. You may be able find a collector car at a local car dealership. You can also find photos and posters online. And there are car magazines. Finally, there are toy, model and remote control cars.<br></p>



<p>Perhaps, just learning something new is what matters. Personally, I would say that hope is what matters. And, it matters where we put on hope. My hope is in God: the Father, Son and Holly Spirit. Where do you find your hope?</p>

<p>&#8220;Jesus loves me, this I know.  Just that sometimes, I have to go real slow.&#8221;</p>



<p>The trend has long been to do more, faster and better than before. I think we all feel the pressure in some way to get more done. Yet, even God took a day off.</p>



<p>There are at least a few ways to take a step back from our work. We just have to figure out what works best for us.</p>



<p>Plan ahead to do nothing. It could mean that you plan to set aside a few minutes each day, or it could mean that you plan to take a full day off each week. It also means figuring out what you may need to do or to put off in order to take this time.</p>



<p>By doing nothing, I don’t mean that you have to lie in bed and not move. What I’m talking about may look like one of the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Take a nap.</li>



<li>Call a friend.</li>



<li>Journal.</li>



<li>Pray or pick up a Bible.</li>



<li>Draw, crochet, cook or something else.</li>



<li>Take a leisurely walk.</li>
</ul>



<p>These are just a few ideas. The thing is that some of us — myself included — have to plan things or else they just don’t happen. And, for me, even putting something on a to-do list dues’t guarantee that it will get done.</p>



<p>The thing is to do something that you will enjoy doing. And keep it simple. Don’t think, as I some times do, my neighbor’s lawn needs cleaning, so I’m going to take care of that. Yes, there is a time for these things, but it cannot replace taking at least a little time to replenish ourselves.</p>



<p>Can taking time off be taken to extremes? Yes, everything can. That’s probably why God limited it to one day. And when God gave us 10 commandments, taking time off was just one of them — and not even the first.</p>



<p>We can keep ourselves so busy that we forget what we are doing it for. What we do, we should do out of love. Whether it’s working or taking time to help someone else, cooking, drawing or helping little old ladies across the street, we should do it out of love.</p>



<p>Remember, God loved us so much that He sent His one and only son to die for us so that He could restore a broken relationship between us. Yes, God had to plan ahead. He had to sacrifice something He loved. But He loved us that much.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There are at least three things that can keep us from being creative. Being too busy, stress and self doubt are some of the worst. But there are things that we can do.</p>



<p><strong>Busyness</strong><br>It’s easy to be too busy. We have one thing after another to take care of and, before we know it, the day is gone and it’s time to go to bed. Life just needs to have so many demands.</p>



<p>If we want to be creative, especially if this is how we earn our money, we have to set time aside to be creative. It may just take an hour or so, but if we don’t make a conscious effort, it isn’t going to happen on it’s own. Some people have been know to set aside not only a time to be creative, but also have a particular place where they do their creative work. Others have even left familiar surroundings to find time to be creative — a cabin in the woods or some other place.</p>



<p><strong>Stress</strong><br>Stress and worry are big creativity killers. They seem to take up all of our thoughts and make it difficult to do anything but worry. Often, the things that we worry about are nothing we can change, but that doesn’t keep us from worrying about them, anyway.</p>



<p>One thing that helps me when I have a lot on my mind is to just take time to write about them. Somehow, getting things on paper, or into a journal on my computer, often helps clear my mind. The nice thing is that it not only helps me to be creative, but it can help me sleep better at night.</p>



<p>Talking with someone about the things that are bothering you may help, too, and may even provide insights that we might have otherwise missed. It may be good to talk not only about the things that are bothering you but also the work that you need to accomplish. Who knows what ideas you may be able to come up with together.</p>



<p><strong>Self doubt</strong><br>You can always find someone to tell you that you’re not good at something. Dr. James Dobson was told that he couldn’t write, but that was before he published several best selling books. If someone else doesn’t tell us that we’re no good at something, we might just tell ourselves that.</p>



<p>In reality, very few pick up a paint brush or any other tool and are immediately amazing artists. That doesn’t mean that we should give up. I tried several things before I began writing and, really, I do it just because I enjoy it. I also enjoy taking pictures. Certainly, not all of my photos are of museum quality, but that doesn’t stop me.</p>



<p>Don’t forget, there are ways to learn to get better at whatever you want to do. You can read books or watch videos. You can even take classes and have someone teach you in person. The main thing is that you are practicing you art.</p>



<p>Being creative may or may not help us make a living. One of my favorite photographers, David Burnett, was already a well known and well published photographer, but that didn’t keep him from trying new things that would make his work stand out from the rest. The important thing isn’t the tools we own but the brain that we have that imagines the work that can be done and makes the commitment to do that work. And if we make a real commitment, almost nothing can stop us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I saw a calendar that had on the cover “I’m very busy.” It seems to be something that a lot of people brag about. But does staying busy mean that we are getting more done or that the work that we are doing is of greater value?</p>



<p>In life, it’s easy to get distracted. It’s usually the shiny, the impressive or the urgent that catch our attention and take us away from the things that matter. It’s the fact that we are busy that makes us think that what we are doing is of significance. And it may be. Only we can answer that question.</p>



<p>I was out taking pictures with an old digital camera that I have and one of the pictures that I got has two important lessons for each and ever one of us when it comes to our career or to our creative life, and probably our life in general.</p>



<p>The first lesson is to stay focused. It’s kind of a play on words, because the picture is out of focus. The idea is that we, at some point in our lives, need to decide what is most important and try to rid our lives of the things that aren’t as important. This can be material possessions, but it can also be activities that keep us from doing what really matters.</p>



<p>Some time ago, I stopped watching television. That isn’t to say that I don’t watch things online. Yet, I try to reduce the amount of mindless things that I watch and watch more of the things that will help build my knowledge base. If I put on the mindless stuff, it’s usually just to have some noise in the background when I’m doing something else.</p>



<p>The other thing that this picture illustrates is that we shouldn’t bite off more than we can chew. Okay, so this bird more than likely can eat the large seed in its beak, after it removes the outer shell. Still, it may be tempting to take on more than we can do.</p>



<p>Taking on more than we should not only keeps us from doing what is important, but it can add unneeded stress to our lives. Over time, this stress can be hard on our minds and bodies.</p>



<p>As a whole, at least in the United States, we have become consumers. We spend all of our time, buying things and consuming or taking in things of very little value. Being creative, doing work that matters, whether it’s creating a great work of art or raising a family, takes time. It takes commitment and focus to get the absolute best that we can get out of what we are doing.</p>



<p>It’s not possible to know what our future selves might tell ourselves. I heard one lady on the radio say that she would tell her past self to have more fun, to enjoy the time that she spent with her little children more, because the things that mattered then aren’t the things that matter now.</p>



<p>Take the advise of a little bird. As much as possible, stay focused on the things that matter most. It may cost some of the things that we think are important, now. Second, don’t bite off more than you can chew. You may have to work on that as time goes. Don’t be afraid to put things off, to discontinue them or even ask for help from others. Your future self may thank you for it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I used to tell management at the store that I thought they should look at the dates on the wine bottles because, “I think they’ve expired.” Is it possible to die with ones song still inside? Is it possible for our potential to expire? It’s been said that the richest place is the graveyard because it is full of so much unused potential.</p>



<p>We get just one chance at this life. It may seem to stretch out for some time and there are times when the clock seems like it is broken. Yet, we only get one shot at this life and there is no going back.</p>



<p>There may be a book inside of me but, after at least a few attempts, it seems as though it’s never going to come out. Instead, for now, I write my blog and enjoy taking pictures while I go on long walks. These may not be things that I have to do, but they are things that I want to do.</p>



<p>Each of us express ourselves in unique ways. It may be through some form of art, in song, in writing, or in some other way. And for every expression, there is someone who is meant to hear or see it. Just because I don’t enjoy certain music does’t mean that someone else doesn’t. As beauty is in the eye of the beholder, so our unique expression of who we are is beautiful to someone else.</p>



<p>Each of us is given the same twenty-four hours in a day and, yet, some people seem to be able to do so much more within that time. Some people make way more money that others, while other people are able to create such astounding works of art.</p>



<p>The thing that we often forget is that whatever we are able to do or not able to do does not establish our value; God does. God created everything and, because we are made in the image of God, we are also creative.</p>



<p>What is sad is not that we might die with our creativity still in us but that many people use their creativity for the wrong thing. Too many use their creativity and their intelligence to come up with new ways to steel from others.</p>



<p>Probably the greatest treasure isn’t found in cemeteries but in Heaven. Not only does Heaven have at least one street made of gold, but God paid a great price to get those who are in Heaven there by sending his Son to die on a cross.</p>



<p>I’ve heard that we’ll still get to use our gifts in Heaven, that we will use the gif that God gave us on earth in Heaven. There are a lot of things that I like to do. I wonder which of my gifts I might be able to use in Heaven.</p>



<p>My friends have a little girl who has never been able to do anything in her whole life other than lay there. I wonder what she might be able to do in Heaven after she gets her new body. In the eyes of the world, she hasn’t contributed anything. But she is still very much loved and she is still special. It’s not always what the world sees that matters. It is what God sees that counts.</p>

<p>Creativity is something that we are born with. And as soon as we are able, with few exceptions, we all start creating things. it may be finger paints or the drawing on the hallway wall. It’s very unlikely that, at the age of six, we are creating masterpieces but, given the resources, being creative is something that comes natural.</p>



<p>The problem is that, with age, many of us loose the desire to be creative. In jr. high, I really enjoyed drawing. And when I had a decent teacher, I did fairly well. But there were things that made me decide not to pursue art in high school. At the same time, I picked up on photography and never let it go.</p>



<p>As far as drawing, it is something that I would really have to work at. And, right now, I don’t really have the desire.</p>



<p>Creativity may be something that comes, but skill is something that we have to work on. Some people pick up on a form of art more easily but whatever we choose to do, we have to work on it, practicing to get better and better.</p>



<p>Focusing on the tools of the craft — cameras for photographers, brushes for painters and microphones for singers — may be exciting, but the most important tool is the mind. It’s the ability to think of new ways of doing things and the desire to learn new techniques that helps us to stand out.</p>



<p>For many, the art that we create matter only to us. Some are able to become professionals in their craft. Few have had their work stand the test of time. Yet, it’s important that we are able to find a way to express ourselves in one way or another.</p>



<p>If you find yourself unable to get out, now may be a perfect time to sharpen your skills. Even with restrictions, I’m still able to get out and take pictures. And, if I really worked at it, I could find things to photograph indoors.</p>



<p>Right now, I’m working more on my writing. I’m not sure whether I’m getting better or not, but it’s something that I enjoy doing. If someone else enjoys reading what I have to write, that’s just an added bonus.</p>



<p>What is it that you enjoy doing? Is there something that you used to do that you would like to get back to doing? Maybe there is something that you can teach to others. Or maybe you can just hone your skills.</p>



<p>Your work may just matter to you, but it still matters. You may not have the skills of a master, but don’t compare yourself with others. Your job is to get better than you wire yesterday, or a hundred yesterdays ago. And, whatever your skill level, don’t give up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>“Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.” ―Albert Einstein</p>



<p>Imagination is built on what we know. But it may also be limited by what we know. It’s taking what we know, and asking the what if questions. What if we put these two things together. What if we made this smaller. What if we used this instead of that.</p>



<p>“Imagination is the source of every form of human achievement. And it&#8217;s the one thing that I believe we are systematically jeopardizing in the way we educate our children and ourselves.”<br>― Sir Ken Robinson</p>



<p>The more we know, the more we have to work with. Yet, imagination is not necessarily limited by our knowledge. It is limited only by our desire to try new things. It is not necessarily limited by our resources, but by our ability to believe in what we can and cannot do.</p>



<p>Children have some of the most active imaginations. As children, there seems to be no limit to what we can do, who we can be, or what we can create. But there are certain things that we need in order to exercise our imaginations.</p>



<p>For one, we need to put the right things into our minds, or our imaginations will take us down the wrong path. Reading, exploring, and listening are just a few things that we can do to help build our imaginations.</p>



<p>Having a safe place is another thing that we need in order to activate our imaginations. We can’t be worried about our own safety and use our imaginations at the same time. If we worry about what tomorrow might bring, we may be using our imagination, but probably in the wrong way. We need a place that we can get away from the worry and the business of the world around us so that we can imagine what could be.</p>



<p>A safe place may be out in the woods, your favorite chair at your favorite cafe, your own bed. For those who choose meditation, they find their safe place in their mind. A safe place is some place that we are free to think, free to ask questions and, most importantly, it’s a place that we are free from judgment.</p>



<p>We also need time: time to think, to dream, to ask questions and to wonder “what if.” If we’re too busy, have too many things on our mind, or just too tired to think, we won’t be able to creatively use our imaginations.</p>



<p>If our imagination is to be successful, we will also need the freedom to try, to experiment, to create hypotheses and to test them. We need the freedom to try new things. And we need the freedom to fail, or just to find out what doesn’t work, depending on how you look at it.</p>



<p>If we are to accomplish greater things, we will need to combine our resources and use the imaginations of others. Others can bring their own understanding as well as knowledge that we may lack. And together, we can find answers that we might never find on our own.</p>



<p>Imagination may just be the start, but it’s where everything starts. Every actin, every invention, and every work of art began as a though or a question. How are you using your imagination? What are you dreaming of?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’m not exactly sure how old I was when I took my first photograph. I know that my dad had a camera and took pictures of the family as well as for work. I also know that some time around 1980, my mom took a photograph class at the university and that’s about the time I became interested in taking pictures.</p>



<p>A lot has changed over the years in the area of photography. For example, it seems that just about everyone has access to a camera these days. They’re on phones and security devices, drones and computers. When I started taking pictures, it wasn’t that way. There were no digital cameras and, if there were, they weren’t available to the general public. There were fewer photographers, especially in photography’s early years and even fewer who stood out for the work they did. Now, it seems that we’re all photographers and, it would seem, that it is even harder to stand out among other photographers.</p>



<p>Photography has always been fairly expensive. Companies like Eastman Kodak made it easier for families to own cameras in 1888 with the introduction of the Kodak. The Brownie was another film camera. Now, there are actually more camera companies, and a lot more cameras and camera types to choose from. And, though there isn’t the price of film and developing to keep in mind, but there is the price of the price of the camera, itself, memory cards, batteries and anything else that you care to add. Oh, and the first digital cameras — the first DSLRs — they had a price tag of about $5,000.</p>



<p>The quality of cameras and the photographs that they take has changed over the years. The first cameras were actually boxes with just a hole for a lens. An artist had to draw or paint the image. Film was later introduced and now we have film and digital. And the quality of both has greatly increased over time. That DSLR that cost $5,000 would have hardly produced a picture any larger than a post card. And it wasn’t until around the year 2000 that digital cameras even came close to producing the quality of images that a film camera could do. Now, we can do things with digital cameras that one could hardly imagine doing with film.</p>



<p>When I started taking pictures, I also learned how to develop black and white film and prints. I had access to a darkroom and supplies and I could spend hours working on just a few images. It was by no means, instant and color film could take a week or more to get back for a photo lab. With film, with the exception of instant cameras, there was no way to check the quality of your pictures until you developed the film or had someone else develop it. Now, we just have to look at the back of our camera or on our smart phone. We can even have a camera set up remotely and check the images on a smart device.</p>



<p>Laws have changed somewhat over the years. It’s still legal to photograph others in public. But it’s harder, in some cases to use these pictures. Rules of courtesy haven’t changed. Rules of composition and what makes a “good” photograph still hasn’t changed. And everyone is a great photographer until he or she begins comparing their work to the work of other, more experienced, photographers.</p>



<p>There are more ways to make money as a photographer, now, but there is also more competition. A single photographer can produce hundreds of thousands of images and sell them online, yet there there is still a need to fill photography gaps. Anyone can photograph a wedding, but only one photographer may have the style that suits a particular customer’s needs. It takes time and effort to get into photography as a career these days. It takes time to develop one’s style and to make significant improvement in image quality. Then it takes time for others to get to know and appreciate your work. And, if you want to make big bucks, you have to find clients with the needs and the resources to pay that money.</p>



<p>I still own a film camera — a Minox —but I don’t really use it. The last pictures I took were black and white and, without access to a dark room, these pictures took at least 2 weeks to get back. Also, when I got the pictures back, they were badly underexposed. I don’t know, but it was a fairly recent purchase and I think there is a problem with the light meter. I have a really nice camera, now. It’s the nicest camera I’ve ever had. But, these days, I get most of my pictures with my phone.</p>
