<p>Amelia Earhart was born on July 24, 1897. If she’s still alive, she would be 127 years old. Unfortunately her plane disappeared and Mrs. Earhart is presumed dead. Today is Amelia Earhart Day. And, though we could celebrate with cake and ice cream, there might be other ways to celebrate this day.</p>



<p>First, we could study the life of Mrs. Earhart, who was born in Kansas and grew up to do what women in her days dared not do. She entered a man’s world of flying and conquered it. Unfortunately, the plane that set her free probably took her life. But what’s worse, to die trying or to never attempt to do what you feel you were born to do? Each of us has to answer that for ourselves.</p>



<p>Second, we can make paper airplanes and fly them. If there’s more than one person, we can compete to see whose airplane flys the furthers or stays in the air the longest.</p>



<p>Third, we can watch a documentary on Amelia Earhart. I’m sure there is something on iTunes or, at least YouTube.</p>



<p>Finally and, perhaps, more importantly, we can follow our dream, wherever it leads. Is there something that you’ve wanted to do but have been too afraid to do it? Maybe you just haven’t found the time. I don’t mean cleaning the dishes or folding the clothes. It may mean saying “Hi” to that someone you’ve been afraid to talk to. It may mean taking a flight to some place you’ve always wanted to go. Or it may just be time to check into the price of flights. Today might be the day to take that first step.</p>



<p>Faith comes to mind. Faith is the belief in something that we cannot see or that hasn’t happened yet. It says that, if I do something, I’ll be okay or safe and that it might make me happier. Fear says that I’m going to die if I do my laundry or as a girl out to a movie. It’s your choice: choose faith.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today is National Personal Chef Day</p>



<p>This is exciting. Whether you currently have a personal chef or you can barely afford your next meal, this day is for you.</p>



<p>No, really. Having a personal chef may be a great idea and, if you are thinking about hiring one, the prices may be better than you thought. If another PBJ sandwich seems on the horizon, this information could help.</p>



<p>If you want the services of a personal chef, these tips could help.</p>



<p>Figure out a budget. Is your food budget $10, $100, or $1,000? It’s important to know. And, if need be, you can use cash.</p>



<p>Collecting coupons may help reduce the cost of groceries. I find basic ingredients — eggs, flour, milk and such — work best. Add a few ingredients, and there are so many things that you can make.</p>



<p>Plan your meals, based on simple recipes. The simpler the foods, the more likely you are to stick to the plan. Some things, like a dry pancake mix, can be made up ahead of time. A planner may come in handy, where you can plan a shopping day as well as menu options.</p>



<p>Note: it’s better to have extra options instead of having too few and having to go back to the store to buy one or two items (snacks).</p>



<p>Here are some options:<br>Oatmeal<br>Ground beef<br>Burger Buns<br>Carrots (cooked or uncooked)<br>Noodles<br>Soups<br>Mixed Greens</p>



<p>These are just a few things that you can buy. The thing to remember is to buy according to the menu plan and to the budget. Keep in mind that food often costs more than we expect. It may be better to overestimate the cost of food.</p>



<p>One helpful purchase might be containers. You can portion out food and place it in storage: the pantry, fridge or freezer. If you like, you can either label these containers with “Use By” dates, the name of the item, or the date and meal that you intend to use it. Some things freeze well, while others don’t. Some things, like mixed greens, may need to be made into a salad at the last minute.</p>



<p>So many recipes are available online. If you are in the mood for chicken, see if you can buy chicken in bulk, even if you have to portion it out and freeze it. Just don’t do as I did once and leave it out overnight. Oops.</p>



<p>Keep a running list of groceries and, remember, you don’t have to buy everything on the list: just what you absolutely need and can afford. Soup may mean canned, or fresh ingredients for the same.</p>



<p>These tips from a person chef wanna-be are free and could save you a lot of money. Of course, you can also go out to eat. Restaurants these days are struggling. Just don’t make it your job to keep them in business.</p>



<p>Let me know your ideas. Thanks, in advance.</p>

<p>Today is Collector Car Appreciation Day. Try saying that three times fast.<br>It’s not just about old or fancy and unique cars. A while industry has been built around the automobile. Globally, revenue from just the sale of cars, themselves, was about $31.5 billon, with a growth rate of about 8%. That’s a lot of money and outdoes most stocks on the US Stock Exchange.</p>



<p><br>Aside from the cars, there is petrol, oil changes, car washes, hotel stays, advertising fees, photographers and models. It all adds up, and this money goes out to local businesses.<br>My dream car is a Mercedes, convertible from the early 1980s. I will probably never own one, but it’s nice to dream. It would likely be deep blue with brown leather seats.</p>



<p><br>What is your dream car?</p>



<p>For me, it’s more than a dream of having a particular car. I’m more than happy with the car that I have: a 2017 gray Jeep. I’m even happier that I’m no longer driving a 1991 van: ugly in every way.<br>For me, the Jeep reminds me that things can get better, no matter how I may feel at the moment. It’s also a reminder that my God is my source and my provider. And, because of this, I don’t have to worry about tomorrow.</p>



<p>If I begin to worry, as I am prone to do from time to time, I can go from 0 to panicked in .60 seconds. But, if I keep my eyes on God, and His Word in my heart (mind), there is really nothing to fear.</p>



<p><br>How can we celebrate Collector Car Appreciation Day? It may depend on where you live. If, for example, you live in a rural community, it may be that you or your neighbor has one of these in his or her yard. You may be able find a collector car at a local car dealership. You can also find photos and posters online. And there are car magazines. Finally, there are toy, model and remote control cars.<br></p>



<p>Perhaps, just learning something new is what matters. Personally, I would say that hope is what matters. And, it matters where we put on hope. My hope is in God: the Father, Son and Holly Spirit. Where do you find your hope?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>July 4 is National Barbecue Day, and there’s no better time to learn some of the terms that pit-masters (people skilled in the art of cooking in a barbecue pit) use.</p>



<p><strong>Barbecue</strong><br>Barbecue varies from country to country and in different regions of the United States. The term describes a dry heat cooing method that uses some sort of flame to cook meats over a long period of time. Barbecues very from campfire cooking in that the flame is usually contained to a grill, and the food is cooked directly over the flame.</p>



<p><strong>Baste</strong><br>Brushing liquid such as drippings or other liquids on the meat as it cooks is called basting, and helps keep the meat from drying out.</p>



<p><strong>Basting Brush</strong><br>A basing brush is a bush used to baste meats. You want something designed for food use that will not loose its bristles on the food.</p>



<p><strong>Black and Blue</strong><br>Meat that is cooked quickly, charring the meat on the outside while leaving it rare the inside, is called black and blue.</p>



<p><strong>Brochette</strong><br>The French term for kabob, food cooked on a skewer, is a brochette.</p>



<p><strong>Burn Pot</strong><br>A burn pot is where the wood pellets ignite and produce the heat and smoke.</p>



<p><strong>Drip Pan</strong><br>A drip pan is a metal or disposable foil pan that is placed under food to catch drippings when grilling. A drip pan can also be made from aluminum foil.</p>



<p><strong>Charcoal Briquettes</strong><br>Compacted ground charcoal, coal dust, and starch are used to form briquettes that are used as fuel in charcoal grills.</p>



<p><strong>Charcoal Grill</strong><br>A grill that is designed for use with charcoal, rather than gas or wood pellets.</p>



<p><strong>Fat Cap</strong><br>The fat cap is the thick layer of fat between the meat and the skin. The meat should be placed so that the fat cap is in top, allowing the fat to run down the meat.</p>



<p><strong>Fire Box</strong><br>The fire box is the bottom part of the grill that holds the fire or heat.</p>



<p><strong>Gas Grill</strong><br>A gas grill is a grill that is designed to use either propane or natural gas. These grills are easier to use than other types of grills and they heat up faster, but may not give meats the same flavor as other types of grills.</p>



<p><strong>Grill</strong><br>The place where you are cooking your barbecue, and the process of barbecuing.</p>



<p><strong>Kabobs</strong><br>Pieces of meat, poultry, seafood, and/or vegetables, threaded on a skewer and grilled are called kabobs.</p>



<p><strong>Lump Charcoal</strong><br>Carbon residue of wood that has been charred, usually in the form of lumps, is called lump charcoal. It is used as the heat source in charcoal grills.</p>



<p><strong>Marinade</strong><br>A marinade is a liquid that helps tenderize meats or adds flavor to meats. Marinades are made from a wide variety of liquids including soy sauce, wine or fruit juice, and often contain fresh or dried herbs and/or spices.</p>



<p><strong>Marinate</strong><br>To marinate is the process of using a marinade on the meat before cooking it.</p>



<p><strong>Mop</strong><br>A mop is a thin, usually vinegar based sauce (like BBQ sauce) that is basted on a piece of meat while it’s cooking.</p>



<p><strong>Rub</strong><br>Rubs are either of the wet or dry variety and are full of spices, herbs and seasonings that enhance the flavor of the food you are cooking. Rubs can either be rubbed on the meat or just sprinkled on.</p>



<p><strong>Skewer</strong><br>A skewer is a metal or wood stick that us used to hold small pieces of meat, seafood or vegetables for cooking on a grill.</p>



<p><strong>Smoke</strong><br>Meats can be smoked for a couple of reason. First, it can be done to help preserve the meat. Second, it can be done to impart a smoky flavor to the meat. If you are just smoking and not cooking, cheeses can also be smoked.</p>



<p><strong>Tenderize</strong><br>Tougher costs of meat can be tenderized to make them easier to eat. Mechanical tenderizing means using something like a hammer to break up the fibers of the meat, while certain tenderizers can do the same thing, but may take longer. Mango is one thing that will tenderize meats, but be careful not to leave the meat in too long, or it could fall apart before you even get it to the grill.</p>



<p><strong>Wood Chips</strong><br>Natural wood chips can be added to a fire to impart a smoky flavor to food as it cooks. Alder, apple, cherry, hickory, maple, mesquite, and oak are some of the more popular wood chips that can be used. Often, they are soaked in a liquid to keep them from boring too quickly. The wood chips can also be soaked in a liquid, like a brine or a simple syrup, that may impart its own flavor to the food.</p>



<p><strong>Wood Pellets</strong><br>Wood pellets are used in socially designed grills.</p>



<p>Maybe you learned something new. This may not be a complete list of the terms used in barbecuing. Perhaps you have some of your own to add to the list.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&#8220;Jesus loves me, this I know.  Just that sometimes, I have to go real slow.&#8221;</p>



<p>The trend has long been to do more, faster and better than before. I think we all feel the pressure in some way to get more done. Yet, even God took a day off.</p>



<p>There are at least a few ways to take a step back from our work. We just have to figure out what works best for us.</p>



<p>Plan ahead to do nothing. It could mean that you plan to set aside a few minutes each day, or it could mean that you plan to take a full day off each week. It also means figuring out what you may need to do or to put off in order to take this time.</p>



<p>By doing nothing, I don’t mean that you have to lie in bed and not move. What I’m talking about may look like one of the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Take a nap.</li>



<li>Call a friend.</li>



<li>Journal.</li>



<li>Pray or pick up a Bible.</li>



<li>Draw, crochet, cook or something else.</li>



<li>Take a leisurely walk.</li>
</ul>



<p>These are just a few ideas. The thing is that some of us — myself included — have to plan things or else they just don’t happen. And, for me, even putting something on a to-do list dues’t guarantee that it will get done.</p>



<p>The thing is to do something that you will enjoy doing. And keep it simple. Don’t think, as I some times do, my neighbor’s lawn needs cleaning, so I’m going to take care of that. Yes, there is a time for these things, but it cannot replace taking at least a little time to replenish ourselves.</p>



<p>Can taking time off be taken to extremes? Yes, everything can. That’s probably why God limited it to one day. And when God gave us 10 commandments, taking time off was just one of them — and not even the first.</p>



<p>We can keep ourselves so busy that we forget what we are doing it for. What we do, we should do out of love. Whether it’s working or taking time to help someone else, cooking, drawing or helping little old ladies across the street, we should do it out of love.</p>



<p>Remember, God loved us so much that He sent His one and only son to die for us so that He could restore a broken relationship between us. Yes, God had to plan ahead. He had to sacrifice something He loved. But He loved us that much.</p>

<p>I’m not exactly sure how old I was when I took my first photograph. I know that my dad had a camera and took pictures of the family as well as for work. I also know that some time around 1980, my mom took a photograph class at the university and that’s about the time I became interested in taking pictures.</p>



<p>A lot has changed over the years in the area of photography. For example, it seems that just about everyone has access to a camera these days. They’re on phones and security devices, drones and computers. When I started taking pictures, it wasn’t that way. There were no digital cameras and, if there were, they weren’t available to the general public. There were fewer photographers, especially in photography’s early years and even fewer who stood out for the work they did. Now, it seems that we’re all photographers and, it would seem, that it is even harder to stand out among other photographers.</p>



<p>Photography has always been fairly expensive. Companies like Eastman Kodak made it easier for families to own cameras in 1888 with the introduction of the Kodak. The Brownie was another film camera. Now, there are actually more camera companies, and a lot more cameras and camera types to choose from. And, though there isn’t the price of film and developing to keep in mind, but there is the price of the price of the camera, itself, memory cards, batteries and anything else that you care to add. Oh, and the first digital cameras — the first DSLRs — they had a price tag of about $5,000.</p>



<p>The quality of cameras and the photographs that they take has changed over the years. The first cameras were actually boxes with just a hole for a lens. An artist had to draw or paint the image. Film was later introduced and now we have film and digital. And the quality of both has greatly increased over time. That DSLR that cost $5,000 would have hardly produced a picture any larger than a post card. And it wasn’t until around the year 2000 that digital cameras even came close to producing the quality of images that a film camera could do. Now, we can do things with digital cameras that one could hardly imagine doing with film.</p>



<p>When I started taking pictures, I also learned how to develop black and white film and prints. I had access to a darkroom and supplies and I could spend hours working on just a few images. It was by no means, instant and color film could take a week or more to get back for a photo lab. With film, with the exception of instant cameras, there was no way to check the quality of your pictures until you developed the film or had someone else develop it. Now, we just have to look at the back of our camera or on our smart phone. We can even have a camera set up remotely and check the images on a smart device.</p>



<p>Laws have changed somewhat over the years. It’s still legal to photograph others in public. But it’s harder, in some cases to use these pictures. Rules of courtesy haven’t changed. Rules of composition and what makes a “good” photograph still hasn’t changed. And everyone is a great photographer until he or she begins comparing their work to the work of other, more experienced, photographers.</p>



<p>There are more ways to make money as a photographer, now, but there is also more competition. A single photographer can produce hundreds of thousands of images and sell them online, yet there there is still a need to fill photography gaps. Anyone can photograph a wedding, but only one photographer may have the style that suits a particular customer’s needs. It takes time and effort to get into photography as a career these days. It takes time to develop one’s style and to make significant improvement in image quality. Then it takes time for others to get to know and appreciate your work. And, if you want to make big bucks, you have to find clients with the needs and the resources to pay that money.</p>



<p>I still own a film camera — a Minox —but I don’t really use it. The last pictures I took were black and white and, without access to a dark room, these pictures took at least 2 weeks to get back. Also, when I got the pictures back, they were badly underexposed. I don’t know, but it was a fairly recent purchase and I think there is a problem with the light meter. I have a really nice camera, now. It’s the nicest camera I’ve ever had. But, these days, I get most of my pictures with my phone.</p>

<p>I had a chance to talk to Rolf downtown at the Cook County Police Department and these are my findings.</p>



<p>Me: Name?</p>



<p>Rolf: Rolf.</p>



<p>Me: Age?</p>



<p>Rolf: Dog years or people years?</p>



<p>Me: Does it matter?</p>



<p>Rolf: Yes.</p>



<p>Me: Okay, people years.</p>



<p>Rolf: I’m not sure, I was pretty young when I was born, and I lost my birth certificate.</p>



<p>Me: Where were you between the hours of 8 and 9 pm last Friday.</p>



<p>Rolf: At the bar — doing comedy. It doesn’t pay well right now, but I expect to be mediocre some day. Maybe even slightly funny.</p>



<p>Me: Do you have any witnesses to collaborate your story?</p>



<p>Rolf: I’m not sure. I think everyone fell asleep after the first minute of my act. The bartender may have been able to stay awake.</p>



<p>Me: So, Rolf, tell me about yourself. What do you like to do in your free time?</p>



<p>Rolf: Short walks on a long leash.</p>



<p>Me: Where do you like to spend most of your time?</p>



<p>Rolf: In bed.</p>



<p>Me: Other than that?</p>



<p>Rolf: At the dog park.</p>



<p>Me: And what do you do there?</p>



<p>Rolf: I like to check out the girl dogs. You know, do the sniff test. Anyway…</p>



<p>Me: Do you talk to these girl dogs</p>



<p>Rolf: I try to and I’m not shy. I just don’t think they understand me or my sense of humor. I graduated from college, after all. You know, I paid a guy in a dark alley $1,200 for my diploma form Harvard.</p>



<p>Me: Did you actually take any classes?</p>



<p>Rolf: No, why?</p>



<p>Me: What is your favorite food?</p>



<p>Rolf: Cat. No, seriously, I like just about everything — Italian, American, Indian, Hawaiian, Mexican…. I’ve studied British foods but I find most of them to be too bland. And cow tongue, I won’t touch it.</p>



<p>Me: Favorite music.</p>



<p>Rolf: I love <a href="https://amzn.to/3k4mLWQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Audrey Assad</a>. At least her music. I don’t think she would go for a dog like myself. I love it all — some more than others. It’s like a drug to me. I’m addicted. Seriously.</p>



<p>Me: Drugs? Are drug a problem.</p>



<p>Rolf: Yes. My owner drug me to the opera last Saturday. I kept waiting for the fat lady to sing, but there were none.</p>



<p>Me: What do you drink at the bar?</p>



<p>Rolf: Water, unless I they serve a good chai tea. Do you know how hard it is to find a real good chai tea?</p>



<p>Me: No.</p>



<p>Rolf: I found one place near the University of Arkansas but they want almost $6 for a small cup. A good cup of cappuccino is nearly impossible to find and I’m not going to Italy any time soon.</p>



<p>Me: Speaking of going anywhere, maybe you should plan to stay in town for the next week or two.</p>



<p>Rolf: I plan to. I have shows to preform this Saturday and the next. Besides, I just walked form Vegas where my Pa and Grandpa live and, boy, are my Pas tired.</p>



<p>Me: Do you have any tickets?</p>



<p>Rolf: For you? No. It’s first come first serve. Ten dollar minimum.</p>



<p>Me: Okay, Rolf, you’re free to go — for now. You’ve been very funny — I mean “informative”.</p>



<p>Rolf: Thank you, thank you very muuuch. No, wait. If you have extra dog food, make sure you share it with others who are in need. There are a lot of hungry dogs out there. And make sure you share the love. Don’t keep it to yourself.</p>



<p>Me: Ladies and gentlemen — Rolf the Dawg.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Question: How could two little words have so many meanings? But they do.</p>



<p>I remember that as a child, our family had a record player. It played 45’s and the records were about 1/3 the size of the larger records. The first record that I bought for myself was by Keith Green. I remember that I took all the money that I had at the time and — with the help of the cashier — purchased that album. I’m not sure how many times I listened to it but knowing me, it was probably several.</p>



<p>My brother, on the other hand, had a job and so he purchased a sound system. I liked to use it too. He preferred groups like Meatloaf and others that I don’t recall. I liked love songs from Styx, Chicago and Boston.</p>



<p>When CD’s came out, I got one. It took a while before I actually got a CD player. Or maybe it was the other way around.</p>



<p>My first CD was by Michael Card and I know I drove my sister crazy as I listened to it over and over. I know because she told me.</p>



<p>Keeping: having, owning, holding, possessing or maintaining. If you don’t keep something, you sell it or give it away.</p>



<p>Records: any document — printed material — mental, analog or digital. A record may be a physical piece of paper, but it may also be a memory, a 45 album or a photograph. These are just some examples. A $1 bill is a record of a certain percentage of value based on something. It used to be gold, but I’m not sure what it is now.</p>



<p>First Corinthians tells us that love, among other things, “it keeps no record of wrongs.” It tells us that we may have other gifts and we may do great things, “but do not have love, I gain nothing.”</p>



<p>The Bible also tells us that God is love. So, it could be said that if we do not have God, we do not have love and therefore we gain nothing from this life that we live.</p>



<p>What’s required to find God?</p>



<p>Scripture: it could be Genesis 1: 1 that says, “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.” (KJV)<br>Faith: so if you believe in your heart what God says, you have part of it.<br>Confession: It’s confession that, one, I am a sinner and that I need God’s help and, second, that I put my faith in the completed work of the only Son of God. If Jesus was just a teacher or a good guy, he could’t save anyone. And if you think about it, he really did clam to be equal to God and that’s why they killed Jesus.</p>



<p>I don’t remember my prayer because I was too shy to pray out loud. I did believe in my heart, though, and the confession came soon after at baptism. And, if you don’t know, baptism cannot save anyone. Tongues are not a sign of being born again; they are simply a gift for self edification and, perhaps, for the church. I think things like serving and teaching, giving to the church are more prevalent gifts these days. Healing would be nice, but I think it goes back to faith, not need.</p>



<p>Here’s a sample prayer: “God, forgive me. I confess that I am a sinner and that I need Your forgiveness. I accept your gift of salvation that you offer because of the promise in John 3: 16 (“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” — KJV). Thank you for this free gift.”</p>



<p>When you do this, you are sealed with the Holy Spirit, Saved and given eternal life. It’s so simple, and adult can get it.</p>



<p>If you have questions, please email me: ralfie517@gmail.com. Put “Question” in the “about” line. If you have a prayer request, put “Prayer”. If you just want to let me know that you’ve put your faith in Jesus, put “Yes.” This will help me sort though all of the junk that I get to find what I really need to focus on.</p>
