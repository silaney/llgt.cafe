<p>Dear Diary,<br>This was today’s Bible verse: “Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence.” — Isaiah 64:1 (KJV)</p>



<p>To rend is to tear, but with a sense of urgency. It’s as if to say, “God, we need you now.” I find that, these days, I never stop needing God. I need him all of the time, whether I am conscious of my need or not.</p>



<p>Today is Never Give Up Day. It is a worldwide holiday aimed at helping individuals who are suffering from various forms of pain and grief. It is meant as an encouragement us to not give up and keep on going.</p>



<p>Today is also National Fajita Day as well as National Ice Cream Pie Day. And if I had known about either one of these in advance, I might have been better prepared to celebrate. Maybe next year.</p>



<p>Lord,<br>Help me to not give up, but to do it because I know that you are with me.</p>



<p>Help those who have suffered loss. Be with them and encourage them as they face yet another day with whatever it is they are suffering. Thank you that, as long as we are alive, you never give up on us.</p>



<p>May ever day be a day to celebrate because of what Jesus has done on the cross: redeeming me and giving me a future that is better and brighter that I can ever imagine. Thank you.</p>



<p>In Jesus’ name,<br>Amen</p>

<p>Dear Diary,<br>I woke up early enough to go for a walk before church. Today’s teaching was the last in a series on the Sermon on the Mount, from Matthew 7. The thing that sticks out most in my mind is that the narrow road may be hard, but it is the only way to eternal life, for it leads to the only source of eternal life, which is Jesus.</p>



<p>“Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.” — John 14:6 (KJV)</p>



<p>It rained while I was helping with parking. And it was windy, so I think we all got at least a little wet. I got wet because it wasn’t raining when I went into church and had to go to my car to grab my umbrella before going to help with parking</p>



<p>I heated up some chicken as part of my lunch, adding the last of my Chinese BBQ sauce.</p>



<p>The church has Growth Track later today and I signed up to go. I was hoping to audition for singing, but I think I’ll spare them having to hear me sing. Anyway, I’m fine with parking duty.</p>



<p>God,<br>Thank You for loving me. Thank You for sending Jesus to live and to die that I might have eternal life.</p>



<p>Help all of those who are homeless and hungry. But even more than food and shelter, they need to know You.</p>



<p>In Jesus’ name,<br>Amen</p>

<p>Dear Diary,<br>The teaching at church was from Matthew 7. It was on how we should approach God in prayer: with boldness and with confidence. We can approach God with boldness because of what Jesus has done on our behalf and we can approach God with confidence because of who God is.</p>



<p>I managed to go for a walk this morning. Now, it’s too hot and I don’t really want to go anywhere. I just got back from church and had baby bok choy. I’m supposed to meet Colin for burgers for dinner.</p>



<p>I made it to the gym a few days last week. One day I had intended to go, I wound up coming home to unplug something that I had intended to unplug before leaving for work. Oops.</p>



<p>The Olympics are in full swing. I’m not sure who might have one something. It seems that there is a lot of hype when it comes to local businesses that doesn’t come to fruition.</p>



<p>Yesterday, I had baked salmon and cauliflower with sliced lemon on top. I seared both with avocado oil and butter on medium heat before putting them both — in a cast iron skillet — in to an oven, preheated to 35o degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes. It was so good, I could hardly wait for it to cool down before starting to eat it.</p>



<p>God, I pray that You would enter the hearts of man that the world could find the only source of peace, which is Your Son: Jesus Christ. Thank You for loving me. Thank You for Your Word, the Bible. Thank You for my friend, Lily.</p>



<p>In Jesus’ name,<br>Amen</p>

<p>Dear Diary,<br>Happy Sunday. I’ve had my shower and there is time for a walk before church. Fortunately, for me I’m driving to church and don’t have to walk to get there. If I did, I would probably be late.</p>



<p>I’m ready for cooler weather. Yet, it’s still only July and there are at least another five weeks of just too hot before it starts to cool off.</p>



<p>It’s National Hamburger Day and my ground beef is thawed from being in the freezer. I should celebrate after church. I think I’ll call it lunch. It’s also National Milk Chocolate Day. I have some chocolates that I can use to celebrate that, too. Yum. Today is National Waterpark Day, but I would rather celebrate National Air-conditioner Day.</p>



<p>It’s bright enough to go for a walk.</p>



<p>Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. — Matthew 5:3 (KJV)</p>



<p>God,<br>You are holy, God.</p>



<p>Thank you for Today. Thank you for giving me a new day to love you and to love others as myself.</p>



<p>Thank you for giving me enough that I can share what I have with others. You lack nothing and you are kind enough to share what you have with me. God, You alone are good, kind and loving. Thank You for loving me so that I can love others.</p>



<p>Help me to hear what You would have me to hear at church.</p>



<p>Forgive me when I fail.<br>In Jesus’ name,<br>Amen</p>

<p>Dear Diary,<br>The weather was nice when I went for my walk. Now, it’s a little too warm. I saw the same cat that I saw yesterday. I think he’s looking for his home, but all of the apartment buildings look the same in that area.</p>



<p>The good news is that Jesus lives. And because He lives, so do I, through faith. The good news is that Jesus is coming back. The bad news is that He hasn’t come back yet, so there are things that I still have to deal with that I would rather not have to deal with. Smile.</p>



<p>Amazon approved my first children’s book: “I like…. Do you?” Yeah. I’m just waiting for them to put it into their store. I’m hoping to begin working with Laura (my niece) on other books.</p>



<p>I thought that I had seen the next U.S. president in a picture in my newspaper, then I found out that she is running for president. I’m not sure where she stands on anything. I’m not sure if it matters what I know or think I know.</p>



<p>Last night, I used my Gym membership for the first time. I walked for about 22 minutes. I did three chin-ups and two partial ones. I did some other weight lifting, looked around came home to my bed. This morning, after my walk, I made a cheeseburger without the bread: protein for all the muscle I’m building. Smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.&#8221; &#8212; Psalm 1:1-3 (KJV)</p>

<p>Dear Diary,</p>



<p>Morning came too early. Bunnies were out. Squirrels came out later. There was a grey crown night heron near the hospital: just visiting, probably.</p>



<p>It took me about half an hour to make it to the store. When I was close, I heard some homeless guy saying something that doesn’t need to be repeated. Ever.</p>



<p>I decided to take my own advice and picked up a planner, mainly for the purpose of menu planning. It goes from April 2024 though the end of 2025. The other day, I was cleaning up and threw away a 2023 planner that went unused, so I hope that this one actually gets used for what it is intended for.</p>



<p>I got more Play-Doh, because I like it. It’s so much fun to squish and make things with. Unlike Lego, it just has one piece. It seems to just come in four colors.</p>



<p>Yesterday, I joined a local gym. I need to decide when I should go and actually exercise instead of just asking about the membership. This morning, I walked about a mile and a half, then I took the bus back. That counts for something.</p>



<p>I bought another song for my collection: Josh Baldwin’s “Made For More.” I heard it on the radio and decided to buy it. It seems that I got the live version. I like it.</p>



<p>It’s supposed to rain tomorrow. Maybe the rain will bring cooler temperatures.</p>



<p>Now might be a good time to go to the library. Maybe not, I need to go somewhere, in the opposite direction in about half an hour. I thought I was arriving on time last week and it turned out that I was a week early. Who knew. I didn’t.</p>

<p>Dear Diary,<br>It’s been a good day, but I’m ready for it to be over. I woke up, hoping to take a nap. That didn’t work, so I got up — way too early. It was perfect weather to go for a walk, so I walked out to the car and went for a drive: to the store, I went, to buy groceries.</p>



<p>I bought milk and eggs and chicken — just to name a few — and other things I forget. I got art supples for the books that I want to create, and went back for more for the things I forgot.</p>



<p>I phoned, looking for fans, but I only found friends. I went to what was supposed to be a single’s Bible study and no one else showed up.</p>



<p>I’ve decided that Costco should put air conditioning in their parking lot, with heating in the winter.</p>



<p>A friend from high school recognized me at the store and we talked for a while. He owns a T-shirt business, and I am looking for someone to make T-shirts for me.</p>



<p>I just recently found that Lauren Dangle has cytomegalovirus and what it is. I’m praying that God cures her.  </p>



<p>Laundry is done and I left a positive review of the laundromat. The owner is kind and very polite. In case you happen to be in Fayetteville, Arkansas and need to do laundry, the place is called Laundroama.</p>



<p>Later, I hope to back some chocolate chip cookies. They’re for me and the people I work with. It it’s not too hot, I’ll go for a walk. Church is tomorrow and I need my beauty sleep.</p>
