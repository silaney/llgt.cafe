<p>“What did you learn in school, today,” Chris asked his two children, Julia and Daniel.</p>



<p>“We learned about blue green algae,” answered Julia, rather excitedly.</p>



<p>“You mean koombiotic relationships,” Chris asked.</p>



<p>“I think it’s symbiotic, dear,” said Charlotte.</p>



<p>“Oh, yes,” said Chris.</p>



<p>“We learned about eccentric circles,” said Daniel.</p>



<p>“I think you mean…” Charlotte paused. “Never mind.</p>



<p>“What do you have planned for this weekend,” Charlotte asked Chris.</p>



<p>“Well, the school has a football game, tonight. Chris continued, “It’s homecoming, and I’m the queen.”</p>



<p>“You men you’re in charge of the band,” asked Charlotte?</p>



<p>“Right,” said Chris. “And someone has to give away the bride.”</p>



<p>“What do you two have planned for the weekend,” asked Charlotte.</p>



<p>“We’re going to the game,” said Julia and Daniel. “We want to see Dad dressed up like the homecoming queen.”</p>



<p>“He is not dressing up as homecoming queen,” said Charlotte.</p>



<p>Just then, Caff entered the living room.</p>



<p>“Did I hear something about a homecoming queen,” asked Caff,</p>



<p>“It’s going to be a late night for Chris,” said Charlotte. “He has to stay up late for the homecoming game, and then he has to grade papers before next Monday.</p>



<p>“It sounds like he’s going to need some caffeine,” said Caff.</p>



<p>“Noooooo……,” said Chris, rather shocked and alarmed at what he had just heard.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong,” asked Charlotte, as Chris sat up in bed, awoken from a deep sleep.</p>



<p>“Oh, it was horrible,” said Chris. Daniel and I were making all sorts of grammatical errors, and I thought I was going to be homecoming queen.”</p>



<p>“It’s okay,” said Charlotte. “It was only a dream.”</p>



<p>“What’s that,” asked Chris?</p>



<p>“Oh,” replied Charlotte, “it’s a cup of coffee. Caff brought it by for the homecoming game tomorrow night. Remember, you’re homecoming queen.”</p>



<p>“Noooooo…..”</p>

<p>Family all arrived for the wedding of Chris and Charlotte. It was a small wedding in a small chapel on the north side of town. It was a beautiful wedding, and even Caff (short for Caffeine) attended.</p>



<p>The two moved into Chris’ home. Ten months later, Julia was born, weighing in at 6 pounds, nine ounces. And two years after that, Daniel was born, weighing it at 6 pounds, eight ounces. Then there were four.</p>



<p>Chris continued teaching, but put his crime fighting on hold, until… One evening, on his way home from the work, Chris noticed a man standing outside the bank. He looked suspicious, so Chris watched and waited.</p>



<p>Chris started with a song, humming at first, gradually getting louder, Before he knew it, the man was asleep. Just then, two men rushed out of the bank, finding their friend, sound asleep. It seemed that the man who was supposed to drive the get away car was sound asleep.</p>



<p>Chris continued his song and, soon, all three men were sound asleep. Soon, the police were on the scene, and all three men were taken into custody. But the question remained, who had stopped these men? Who was this hero who saved the day. Only we know the truth. Yes, it was Nap Man.</p>



<p>(to be continued)</p>
