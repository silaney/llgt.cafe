<p>Sometimes it’s nice to do something unexpected, for yourself or someone else. If you want to do something by yourself or with or for someone else, here are some ideas.</p>



<p>Go shopping, even if it’s just window shopping. It can be nice to just get out of the place you are at.</p>



<p>Take can unexpected trip. You can plan it ahead, throw a dart at a map or just go where the wind takes you. It can be a lot of fun to go somewhere that you’ve never been before.</p>



<p>Build something. Look around and find out what you have to work with and make something. It could be paper mache or wood. You could build something, carve something or decorate something.</p>



<p>Find a game to play, indoors or out. There’s everything form tic-tac-toe to horseshoes and it’s your choice.</p>



<p>Go out to eat or fix a fancy dinner. This may require a little more preparation depending on what you decide to do, but the result could be well worth it. If it is an option, enlist someone to help you.</p>



<p>Maybe one of these caught your attention. Or, perhaps you came up with your own idea. If so, please comment below.</p>

<p>I’ve picked up several different art supplies over the years, thinking that I would be able to use them for one thing or another.</p>



<p>I picked up clay, thinking I would come up with all sorts of wonderful creations. I even imagined me making an elephant but my creations never got beyond the imagination stage.</p>



<p>I got pencils, colored pencils and pencils that are watercolors. I even got a fancy coloring book, but I’ve hardly used any of them.</p>



<p>I got watercolors and I’ve not used them at all. It’s not that I don’t enjoy watercolors or know how to use them. I do know how to use them. It just seems that I haven’t found the occasion to use them.</p>



<p>I’ve even picked up several art pads and notebooks. One of them has been making a handy pad for my phone. But most of the art pads sit in a stack, unused and hardly touched.</p>



<p>There is one arts and craft item that I have been enjoying, and it is the least expensive of all: that is Play-Doh. I really like the texture and the smell. I don’t have to make anything special out of it and, when I’m done, I can put it right back in it’s container.</p>



<p>Sometimes, the best art supplies aren’t the fanciest or the most expensive. They say that the best camera is the one that you carry around with you. And I find Play-Doh works for me. What craft or crafts do you enjoy most? Please comment below.</p>
