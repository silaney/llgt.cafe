<p>As an introvert, I understand what it’s like to try to make new friends. It can be really hard to meet new people. It can seem, at times, nearly impossible, especially when it seems that everyone is so busy, even if they are just checking their social media account(s). But there is hope.</p>



<p>If you can, put yourself in a social setting. Attend a conference, take a bus somewhere, go shopping or go for a walk in a place where you feel safe — like a mall.</p>



<p>It may take time, but find someone who looks familiar. Try to start a conversation. If it turns into a friendship, great, if not, maybe it will, later. Whether you are an introvert or not, friendships take time.</p>



<p>Introduce yourself and try to remember the other person’s name. Try to make the other person feel comfortable. Remember that the other person may or may not remember your name the next time — or even at the end of the conversation. Remind them of your name, or ask them to remind you of their name.</p>



<p>Humor works. I went up to someone in a store and said that I would dance with them to the music, but I wouldn’t want to embrace them. Even if you don’t immediately have a new friend with whom you can share your deepest secrets, at least you can share your smile with someone.</p>



<p>Finally, look for others who may share your interest. I attended a church where the men were more interested in talking about tractors than other subjects: not interested. Don’t look for people interested in talking about stamp collecting at a supermarket. Instead, join a stamp collecting club.</p>



<p>Yes, it can be hard to meet new people, but it’s not impossible. Try this: cover your mouth and say “impossible”. Now, take your hand and wad up the word before throwing up the word. There, you’ve just taken the word out of your vocabulary. Better yet, give it to God, for nothing is impossible for God.</p>

<p>If you don’t know who Peppa Pig is, ask a five year old. Peppa Pig is a children’s show that starts out with a little pig named Peppa Pig introducing herself and the rest of her family. Her best friend is a rabbit and. It’s a British show that I think can teach us all a few things.</p>



<p><strong>Be respectful</strong><br>Along with trust, respect is among the most important parts of any relationship. It is something that we should show others right away instead of, as some think, that it has to be earned before it can be given.</p>



<p>In order to give respect, however, we have to know what respect is and what is not. And we must first have respect for ourselves. We show respect by understanding that our value comes from our creator. It does not mean giving in to what others want, whatever the cost. It requires trust and honesty and caring for the good of ourselves and of others. To show respect for ourselves and others, we must know when to say “yes” and “no.”</p>



<p><strong>Ask questions</strong><br>Along the same lines as respect, we ought to be able to ask questions. Avoid questions like “Why are you so fat,” and “How could you be such an idiot”. “What do you mean,” and “How did you come to that conclusion” might be better questions. The thing that we want to do is to clarify, to learn more while avoiding making assumptions.</p>



<p><strong>Make up quickly</strong><br>Friends or family may hurt us and sometimes do. Yet, it is almost never done with the intention of causing physical or emotional harm. Avoid cutting off communication. Instead, try to be the first to open up. Talk about your feelings and avoid calling the other person names or attacking someone personally. Just because that person hurt you in some way doesn’t give you permission to hurt them in in return. Your goal is to restore the relationship, not to get even.</p>



<p><strong>Look for ways to help others</strong><br>We all need help at one time or another. Social distancing and pride may make it harder to discover ways that we can help each other, but it’s not impossible. We may be able to find a place where we can volunteer or we may just keep our eyes open to be able to spot some place where we can help.</p>



<p><strong>Have fun</strong><br>Finally, have fun. Find things that you like doing together, even if it’s jumping in muddy puddles. You can always find things that you like doing alone, but try to find things that you enjoy doing with others. And remember “When you jump in muddy puddles, you have to wear your boots.”</p>

<p>I feel like I’ve learned a lot over my lifetime. There are still things that i would like to learn. Now that I have two coworkers who communicate through sign language, I would lie to earn sign language. I used to know the alphabet, but it’s been way too long and I’ve forgotten what I learned. I have learned hello, how are you, thank you and you’re welcome.</p>



<p>I would like to learn programming but, thus far, I’ve not been able to pick it up on my own. This is because I, at one time, want to create apps to sell in iTunes. Or, I could find a job where I would probably make more money than I have been making.</p>



<p>Not that my head is about to explode from knowledge, but I feel like I’ve learned a lot over the years. Yet, there is at least one thing that, no matter how long I live, I hope that I never learn.</p>



<p>Life has taught me one thing and, in reality, more than once; I have a tendency to be gullible. Gullible: “easily persuaded to believe something; credulous.” In other words, you could put my photo and name by the definition. I wouldn’t say that I foolishly believe everything that I hear, but I do have a tendency to believe that, unless proven otherwise, most people are going to be honest in what they say.</p>



<p>You can look for clues as to when someone is being honest. Not looking someone in the eye is one possible sign, but I tend to look kind of upward and to the side when I’m trying to remember certain things. Telling when someone is lying, it can be really hard at times.</p>



<p>I don’t want to learn not to be gullible. To me, I have one of two choices. I can believe that people are being honest with me, or I can believe that people, in general, are liars. I would rather believe that most people are honest.</p>



<p>Sadly, we’ve grown to expect a certain amount of lying from certain professions and, if not lying, leaving out what might be critical information. Layers, people who sell cars, especially used cars, politicians and weather forecasters probably top the list.</p>



<p>Most of the time, when someone is less than honest with me, I eventually find out. Either someone tells me, or I figure out, myself. Unfortunately, if you confront the person, they are more likely to shift the blame rather than admitting what they did and/or apologizing.</p>



<p>So, yes, as long as I’m alive, I hope to keep learning, but I hope to never learn to mistrust others, even if I have to suffer a little bit every now and then.</p>

<p>I checked the mail and there was was a letter marked “Current Owner”. Well, I don’t own any currents and am pretty sure that I never have. I didn’t recognize the sender, either, so I put the letter in the not mine stack.</p>



<p>This morning, I was given news that will impact my income in a negative way for at least three months. Perhaps the worst part of this is that there were three groups of people who could have given me this information more than two weeks ago. Two of them said nothing about the matter, while the third led me to believe that the opposite was true.</p>



<p>Miss communication happens all of the time. It is talked about a lot in the Bible. In the garden, the serpent clearly misrepresented the truth. At least twice in David’s life, there were issues with communication.</p>



<p>I was frustrated, but I did not overreact. As far as whether anyone had any ill intent, or intention to mislead, I doubt it, but to make that sort of judgement is above my pay grade. What is boils down to is that God is my provider, and I have to trust that he will provide.</p>



<p>Joseph was put in a terrible situation and by his own family. Clearly, there was ill intent. In fact, some of his brothers wanted Joseph dead. But when Joseph was clearly in a position to take revenge, he said, “But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.” Genesis 50:20 (KJV)</p>



<p>James 1:17 (KJV) says, “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.” To complain about how things turned out could very well be complaining against God. And, if there really is a problem, I have to believe that God is big enough to take care of it.</p>
