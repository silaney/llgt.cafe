<p>Today is Perfect Family Day. So, what does that mean? Guess what, I don’t think that such a thing exists. It’s kind of like the unicorn, or Bigfoot. Maybe someone has seen it. Maybe someone has even captured a picture of it. But it seems to only exist in the minds of individuals. I’ll get back to that, later.</p>



<p>All of us are too imperfect to, as a family unit, make up a perfect family. We make mistakes, we hurt one another, we say and do things that we know deep down that we shouldn’t. We intentionally or unintentionally do things that hurt the ones that we love the most. How can we, let along a family, be perfect?</p>



<p>Look at it this way. A puzzle isn’t made of square pieces, Each one has a unique image and shape so that it will fit in a precise place. An edge piece does not go in the middle of the puzzle, nor does a piece from the middle go on the edge. Mistakes don’t make us imperfect. And, when we hurt someone we love, when we realize what we’ve done, we can apologize. And we can try to not do the same thing, again.</p>



<p>Seeing it another way, a rare steak may be perfect for me but not for you. Salad may be my perfect dinner, or it may be a burger. Your perfect dinner may be soup and a grill cheese. The thing is, we are all unique.</p>



<p>Unlike the puzzle, God can put us together in ways that don’t fit at first. He may put us a marriage with someone we feel attracted to and, later, seems not to suit us. Yet, God sees marriage as a binding contract — until death. And that doesn’t mean until one or the other feels as if she is dying.</p>



<p>Part of building a relationship is to realize that we don’t always get our way and being okay with that. Another part is having the willingness to let God shape us into the man or woman whom God wants us to be. It really is simple: love God, love others as ourselves. The hard part may be that I may not believe that God can love me. After all, I’m so imperfect. And, not realizing how much God does love me, I cannot fully love God and others.</p>



<p>Another thing is that, if I disrespect God or his creation, I cannot fully love either. Lust, envy and spreading rumors or lies can all distort our views of others and hurt our relationship with a loving God. For a relationship is built from love and love comes from the hormones? No, it comes from the heart. But so does hate and jealousy: so, watch out for these things.</p>



<p>There is evidence that the heart is part of the nervous system that can contain memories. Aside from that, there is muscle memory. Whether memories exist outside of the brain is not what matters. What matters is that love comes from every bit of our being. It comes in the warm embrace as well as the kind deed. It comes from seeing a mistake as an attempt to learn and not as something to be avoided all together.</p>



<p>So, who is it that puts me into the relationship where I find myself? I believe that God does. Who decides when it is time to move on? Again, I believe that God does. Yet, all too often, I believe that I can take that role from God and put it on myself. Maybe you have done that too. Maybe it’s not too late to recognize our mistakes and to make reconciliation: to restore relationships once lost.</p>



<p>Is there such a thing as a perfect family? From our vantage point, probably not. But I can’t see what God sees. And that is what truly matters.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The power went out some time after 7:30 AM. I found out some time around 8 AM. It seems that the rain caused a tree limb to droop down low enough to hit a power line.</p>



<p>It’s an easy fix for the power company. But if I hadn’t seen the power company truck, I would not have known.</p>



<p>What if the power weren’t back on. What would I do if the power outage were more widespread? After a tornado hit neighboring towns a little over 2 years ago, the place where I work lost power for three days.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I have backup lights, and that’s a good place to start. But that’s only a start. I can’t make my instant coffee and, if the power were still out, I wouldn’t want to open my fridge.</p>



<p>So, what is it that I need if the power goes out for an extended time — say, a week or more?</p>



<p>Light<br>Light comes in handy. And, if you have light, it helps to see what you are doing. Along with that is the batteries to power that light.</p>



<p>Water<br>Water may be next, if the water fails to run. LifeStraws are also a good source of clean water. They filter water that is not drinkable and makes it drinkable.</p>



<p>Sheler<br>Assuming that there is no structural damage, as in an earthquake or tornado, some form of protection from the heat or cold may be needed. A battery powered fan may be useful. Extra blankets can also help; sleeping bags work, too.</p>



<p>Food<br>Canned goods may be important. Try to stick with things that you know that you will use, whether in an emergency or not. If you won’t eat it before it expires, you probably shouldn’t buy it.</p>



<p>Planning<br>This includes making plans of what to do if the power goes out. You may check to see if there is still radio. If there is, great. If not, wait. Phone service may or may not work. Check the weather to see if it is raining. You may also check to see if anyone else is without power. If they have power, it’s likely that the problem is in your home or apartment. If you know your neighbors, you may be able to help them with their needs.</p>



<p>Planning can help with a lot of issues in an emergency, such as a power outage. But it can’t solve every issue that might arise. I find that prayer goes a long way, too. In an emergency, teamwork goes much further. It’s a win-win situation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Do you want some good news? I think it’s good, tough you are welcome to disagree.</p>



<p>Deuteronomy 23: 35-36 (KJV) says, “To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste. For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.”</p>



<p>You know what this means? For me, it means I don’t need to judge others or worry about doing so. And, really, I have desire to judge others. It’s too hard to tell who is telling the truth and who is lying. It’s too hard to tell the motives for any given acton. It’s nearly impossible to walk in someone else’s shoes.</p>



<p>No, I don’t know way I do many of the things that I do. So how can I expect myself to be able to understand why others do the things that they do? Answer: I cannot.</p>



<p>Say, for example, I have two children. Say that the two get into a fight and, when confronted, each blames the other. It would be a mistake to choose one over the other, but that is the tendency. Instead, both should be equally punished. Right?</p>



<p>Perhaps, or perhaps not. Maybe the best thing to do would be to help the two to find a way to work it out: to mediate a deal between the two. Far above what punishment could do, this could be a true life lesson.</p>



<p>I don’t know about you, but I am all too quick to judge other’s motives or intent. And, when I do, it can have lasting and negative effects on me and on my relationships.</p>



<p>There is, however, one thing that we can do. We can be open with each other. If something bothers us, we can say, this thing that you are doing makes me uncomfortable. It hurts me when you…..</p>



<p>We should avoid saying things like, “You are a bad person,” and “I don’t like you.” These are things that probably aren’t true, or may be true for a short time. Really, “I don’t like you” is just a way of saying “I’m mad, or sad, or both.”</p>



<p>Instead of judging, I can listen. I can ask questions and try to figure out what went wrong. I can also offer possible solutions. If a fix to the problem is found, great. If not, it may take more time. If no solution is found, maybe one person or the other just don’t want to admit that he or she may be wrong. But, again, it’s not possible for me to know with 100% certainty. Only God knows, and only God can judge the heart.</p>



<p>“Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, ‘Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord’” — Romans 12:19 (KJV)</p>



<p>What do I take away from this? I can and should be more patient — with myself and with others. I don’t need to judge others or their motives. I don’t even really need to judge my own motives. Now, if I need help with a matter, I should find out the best person to talk to. If I need medical advise, I should talk to a doctor. If I need to know how to spell a work, I find that Google works well. If I’m part of a fight, I should realize that I am part of the problem. And when I come to this realization, I should stop, step back and ask, “What is the real problem?”</p>



<p>What do you think? I think that this is good news. But you are welcome to disagree.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Who am I to write about the heart of God? Who do I think I am? Oh, but it’s not really about me. It’s about God.</p>



<p>You may think of it this way. You are entering an intersection and you see a stop sigh. You may stop at that stop sign, or you may decide simply to slow down. After all, there are other cars approaching the intersection, and simply slowing down seems okay. You don’t say to the stop sign, “What right have you to tell me what to do.” It’s simply a sign.</p>



<p>Say, now, that you are entering another intersection. This time, however, there is a clearly marked, clearly visible police car parked near this intersection. I would venture to guess that you (and I) would be more careful to make sure that we stopped at that stop sigh.</p>



<p>Do I know everything about God? Certainly not. Nor can I know everything about you, partly because I don’t have all the answers regarding my own life. Yet, I walk in a relationship with the living God, not because of anything that I have done, but because of the things that God has done. I, by no means feel worthy to write about the heart of God, but I believe that He has put this on my heart. So, it is by faith that I begin writing. And I am trusting God, though His Spirit, to guide me each step along the way as to what I should and should not write.</p>



<p>No, I’m not a stop sign and this material is not designed to make or even to help you stop doing something. Rather, think of it as one of those signs that point you to the highway that you need to take, the gas station where you need to stop or to the hospital that you need to visit. As with any sign, we all need help getting to the place(s) that we need to go. I believe that God gives us signs — that all of creation is one big sign pointing to Him. I also believe that God gave us His written word, the Bible, to point us to Him. And that is what I will base my writing on.</p>



<p>You may or may not agree with the things that I write. However, like the stop sign, I do not care what you may think of me. But the one in the police car may care what you do.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong. God is not waiting for us to mess up so that He can punish us. The truth is that we all have a problem called sin and death. This sin, because of who we are and who God is, separates us from God. God could have said, “Oh, well, they get what they deserve.” But that is not the heart of God. God would not and could not simply let us perish. He loves us too much to let that happen.</p>



<p>There is much that I will not write about. After many years of study and just plain listing to others, I am certainly ware of many of the different views on everything from creation to eschatology (the study of end times). My goal is not to show you that I am right. My goal is simply to let you know or, perhaps to remind you, that God loves you, whoever you are or however you may see yourself.</p>



<p>John 3: 16 (KJV) tells us, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</p>



<p>Oh, I still have questions. And there have certainly been times when I’ve had doubts — even about the love of God in my life. There have even been times when I felt as if I were on of God’s “Oops — how did that get through?” Trust me, my life is no mistake and neither is yours.</p>



<p>I hope this writing is a blessing: a blessing for both you and for me. By this, I don’t mean that God will give us the riches that we desire in this life but that we will be blessed riches of a relationship with the living God — the only one who can give us eternal life. Don’t break out the hats for the pity-party just yet. God has a plan for each of us, for this life and beyond. God loves you and me; that’s reason to celebrate.</p>

<p>What would your rather have?</p>



<p>A million dollars?<br>Free food for life?</p>



<p>A trip to Hawaii?<br>A trip to the country?</p>



<p>A free pass to any more for the rest of your life?<br>The ability to read any book in seconds?</p>



<p>A new car every year for the rest of your life?<br>A car that never needed repairs?</p>



<p>A personal chef for life?<br>A personal trainer for life?<br>The man or woman of your dreams?<br>To be the man or woman of someone else’s dreams?</p>



<p>A relationship with someone whom you think the be the most beautiful or most handsome?<br>A relationship of service and commitment to the other?</p>



<p>You might think that the last one is a trick question, but true, lasting relationships, thought they may begin with physical attraction, won’t last long if that’s all there is. That’s why so many relationships don’t last. A lasting relationship needs a commitment to the other person that goes deeper and seeks to serve and love the other.</p>



<p>“Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.” — 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 (NIV)</p>



<p>There’s nothing in that verse that talks about getting our own way or having things be perfect. In fact, if we keep looking for perfection, we will never find it. But if we seek to serve, whether it be others, or the God who created us, we will become more loving. And, as 1 Corinthians tells us, there is nothing is more important that we can do than love others.</p>

<p>The Bible tells us to greet one another with a holy kiss. And if you like, you can put your arms behind your back and pretend you are kissing someone — as a prank.</p>



<p>I know that, during my short marriage to Sandy, we kissed more than in the rest of my entire life. Sandy died of cancer, but she’s alive in Christ, so she’s with Jesus. Some times, I wish I still had someone to spend time with — to kiss.</p>



<p>Maybe you have someone. This would be a great time to share your love story, so, please comment below.</p>

<p>If you want to spend time with your friends, and are looking for an excuse to get together, these ideas just may help.</p>



<p>Find a movie that you can watch together. If you like, you can bring the TV outside and watch it in the great outdoors. Rent one of the new releases or find an old classic. Make popcorn or other snacks, and have drinks available.</p>



<p>Maybe you can find some place to go hiking. A long walk and fresh air just may be what you and your friend needs. Bring a camera and/or binoculars and, if you like, you can bring along a bird book or look for other things, like plants or mushrooms.</p>



<p>If crafting is your thing, maybe you can find something to make with your friends. You can use just about anything that you want, from wood to wax, paper to paint. Just about anything that you imagine you can make.</p>



<p>You could also cook something together. You could bake or barbecue, you could go shopping for the ingredients or catch them at a nearby lake or river. You could have an old fashion ice cream social, or tea for two.</p>



<p>Maybe you would rather go for a bicycle ride. You could go for a long or short ride. If you don’t have your own bicycle, some bicycle shops offer rentals that you can get by the hour or by the day.</p>



<p>Perhaps you would rather get together to read one of your favorite books. You can take turns reading, and talking about what you have read. This is something that you can do once, or you can get together on a weekly or monthly basis.<br>If you are musically inclined, maybe you can get together to form a band. This doesn’t mean that you have to record an album or go on tour, but you might be able to preform before a small crowd.</p>



<p>If you have some ideas of your own, please share them. We would be glad to hear our ideas.</p>

<p>Trying to get tech to work can seem like getting a three year old to clean up his room.&nbsp; Yet, tech doesn’t have the advantage of being loved, which makes it all the more frustrating when we can’t get it to do what we want. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t know about you, but my frustrations range from phones that mysteriously turn on, open an app and begin doing whatever it pleases.&nbsp; Usually, I can tell that my phone is on because it warms up in my pocket.&nbsp; By the time I notice it, however, the batter has drained half its power.</p>



<p>Software can be another problem. While Adobe offers some of the best software, it can also be some of the most frustrating.&nbsp; Presently, I’m trying to get my computer connected to the internet, but its being very trying. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Love is so important; it should be included in the list of things that we need in order to survive.&nbsp; Like water, air and shelter, love might just be key to survival.&nbsp; And though it may not be necessary for every individual, it is for the survival of the human race. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, we can survive without love, but we cannot thrive without it.&nbsp; And though we can just survive, the better option is to thrive. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Can we find love if and when we are alone?&nbsp; I think so.&nbsp; Why, you may ask? &nbsp; Or, how?&nbsp; It’s simple.&nbsp; If you can find someone else who needs love and, if you are willing to be open and vulnerable, you can find love. &nbsp;</p>



<p>First Corinthians 13 reminds us that, if we don’t have love, our actions, our very lives are useless.&nbsp; For the Bible tells us that God, Himself, is love.&nbsp; We love because He first loved us. &nbsp;</p>



<p>If love is so important, how do we find it?&nbsp; First, search for God.&nbsp; You can “ask Him into your heart.”&nbsp; It’s kind of like giving God your heart.&nbsp; God already owns everything.&nbsp; We just have to surrender our will to His. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, we can decide to meet others where they are.&nbsp; Activity look to help others, meeting then where they are and not where we wish they were.&nbsp; God met us where we were when He sent Jesus to die on a cross.&nbsp; We meet Him when we accept His gift.</p>
