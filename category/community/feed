<p>As much as I enjoy writing, without you, it’s just me. And without your comments, I don’t know whether or not anyone is actually reading what I write.</p>



<p>In my last website, I had a lot of comments. And I had a lot of visitors. But I never knew if the visitors were actual people or just computer programs sent out to try to hack my website. And, with nearly all of the comments, there were links to porn. The rest of the links were to gambling.</p>



<p>What I want is real visits and comments by real people. That, I hope, is where you come in. I want, not to do this all by myself, but together with you. Maybe you can comment. Maybe you just let me know that you read what I wrote. Maybe you can drop me a note at LLGT Cafe, PO Box 2, Fayetteville, AR 72702. I would love to hear from you. And, if you write, I will do my best to write back.</p>



<p>You can also find me on Facebook at: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100086842894531">https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100086842894531</a></p>



<p>Now, July is National Hot Dog Month and there is still time left to celebrate. What does it take? It takes at least a hotdog and a hotdog bun, but that’s just the beginning. Here are a few things that you may want to add to your hotdog:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Pickle Relish</li>



<li>Mustard</li>



<li>Ketchup</li>



<li>Mayonnaise</li>



<li>Ranch Dressing</li>



<li>Horseradish Sauce</li>



<li>Salsa</li>



<li>Chili, for a chili dog</li>



<li>Cheese, shredded or melted</li>



<li>BBQ Sauce</li>
</ul>



<p>What ideas can you come up with? How do you cook your hot dog? Do you microwave it or grill it? I would like my hot dog with a baseball game and soda, please. Comment your ideas below and have a great National Hot Dog Month.</p>

<p>As an introvert, I understand what it’s like to try to make new friends. It can be really hard to meet new people. It can seem, at times, nearly impossible, especially when it seems that everyone is so busy, even if they are just checking their social media account(s). But there is hope.</p>



<p>If you can, put yourself in a social setting. Attend a conference, take a bus somewhere, go shopping or go for a walk in a place where you feel safe — like a mall.</p>



<p>It may take time, but find someone who looks familiar. Try to start a conversation. If it turns into a friendship, great, if not, maybe it will, later. Whether you are an introvert or not, friendships take time.</p>



<p>Introduce yourself and try to remember the other person’s name. Try to make the other person feel comfortable. Remember that the other person may or may not remember your name the next time — or even at the end of the conversation. Remind them of your name, or ask them to remind you of their name.</p>



<p>Humor works. I went up to someone in a store and said that I would dance with them to the music, but I wouldn’t want to embrace them. Even if you don’t immediately have a new friend with whom you can share your deepest secrets, at least you can share your smile with someone.</p>



<p>Finally, look for others who may share your interest. I attended a church where the men were more interested in talking about tractors than other subjects: not interested. Don’t look for people interested in talking about stamp collecting at a supermarket. Instead, join a stamp collecting club.</p>



<p>Yes, it can be hard to meet new people, but it’s not impossible. Try this: cover your mouth and say “impossible”. Now, take your hand and wad up the word before throwing up the word. There, you’ve just taken the word out of your vocabulary. Better yet, give it to God, for nothing is impossible for God.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The power went out some time after 7:30 AM. I found out some time around 8 AM. It seems that the rain caused a tree limb to droop down low enough to hit a power line.</p>



<p>It’s an easy fix for the power company. But if I hadn’t seen the power company truck, I would not have known.</p>



<p>What if the power weren’t back on. What would I do if the power outage were more widespread? After a tornado hit neighboring towns a little over 2 years ago, the place where I work lost power for three days.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I have backup lights, and that’s a good place to start. But that’s only a start. I can’t make my instant coffee and, if the power were still out, I wouldn’t want to open my fridge.</p>



<p>So, what is it that I need if the power goes out for an extended time — say, a week or more?</p>



<p>Light<br>Light comes in handy. And, if you have light, it helps to see what you are doing. Along with that is the batteries to power that light.</p>



<p>Water<br>Water may be next, if the water fails to run. LifeStraws are also a good source of clean water. They filter water that is not drinkable and makes it drinkable.</p>



<p>Sheler<br>Assuming that there is no structural damage, as in an earthquake or tornado, some form of protection from the heat or cold may be needed. A battery powered fan may be useful. Extra blankets can also help; sleeping bags work, too.</p>



<p>Food<br>Canned goods may be important. Try to stick with things that you know that you will use, whether in an emergency or not. If you won’t eat it before it expires, you probably shouldn’t buy it.</p>



<p>Planning<br>This includes making plans of what to do if the power goes out. You may check to see if there is still radio. If there is, great. If not, wait. Phone service may or may not work. Check the weather to see if it is raining. You may also check to see if anyone else is without power. If they have power, it’s likely that the problem is in your home or apartment. If you know your neighbors, you may be able to help them with their needs.</p>



<p>Planning can help with a lot of issues in an emergency, such as a power outage. But it can’t solve every issue that might arise. I find that prayer goes a long way, too. In an emergency, teamwork goes much further. It’s a win-win situation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Do you want some good news? I think it’s good, tough you are welcome to disagree.</p>



<p>Deuteronomy 23: 35-36 (KJV) says, “To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste. For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.”</p>



<p>You know what this means? For me, it means I don’t need to judge others or worry about doing so. And, really, I have desire to judge others. It’s too hard to tell who is telling the truth and who is lying. It’s too hard to tell the motives for any given acton. It’s nearly impossible to walk in someone else’s shoes.</p>



<p>No, I don’t know way I do many of the things that I do. So how can I expect myself to be able to understand why others do the things that they do? Answer: I cannot.</p>



<p>Say, for example, I have two children. Say that the two get into a fight and, when confronted, each blames the other. It would be a mistake to choose one over the other, but that is the tendency. Instead, both should be equally punished. Right?</p>



<p>Perhaps, or perhaps not. Maybe the best thing to do would be to help the two to find a way to work it out: to mediate a deal between the two. Far above what punishment could do, this could be a true life lesson.</p>



<p>I don’t know about you, but I am all too quick to judge other’s motives or intent. And, when I do, it can have lasting and negative effects on me and on my relationships.</p>



<p>There is, however, one thing that we can do. We can be open with each other. If something bothers us, we can say, this thing that you are doing makes me uncomfortable. It hurts me when you…..</p>



<p>We should avoid saying things like, “You are a bad person,” and “I don’t like you.” These are things that probably aren’t true, or may be true for a short time. Really, “I don’t like you” is just a way of saying “I’m mad, or sad, or both.”</p>



<p>Instead of judging, I can listen. I can ask questions and try to figure out what went wrong. I can also offer possible solutions. If a fix to the problem is found, great. If not, it may take more time. If no solution is found, maybe one person or the other just don’t want to admit that he or she may be wrong. But, again, it’s not possible for me to know with 100% certainty. Only God knows, and only God can judge the heart.</p>



<p>“Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, ‘Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord’” — Romans 12:19 (KJV)</p>



<p>What do I take away from this? I can and should be more patient — with myself and with others. I don’t need to judge others or their motives. I don’t even really need to judge my own motives. Now, if I need help with a matter, I should find out the best person to talk to. If I need medical advise, I should talk to a doctor. If I need to know how to spell a work, I find that Google works well. If I’m part of a fight, I should realize that I am part of the problem. And when I come to this realization, I should stop, step back and ask, “What is the real problem?”</p>



<p>What do you think? I think that this is good news. But you are welcome to disagree.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today is Collector Car Appreciation Day. Try saying that three times fast.<br>It’s not just about old or fancy and unique cars. A while industry has been built around the automobile. Globally, revenue from just the sale of cars, themselves, was about $31.5 billon, with a growth rate of about 8%. That’s a lot of money and outdoes most stocks on the US Stock Exchange.</p>



<p><br>Aside from the cars, there is petrol, oil changes, car washes, hotel stays, advertising fees, photographers and models. It all adds up, and this money goes out to local businesses.<br>My dream car is a Mercedes, convertible from the early 1980s. I will probably never own one, but it’s nice to dream. It would likely be deep blue with brown leather seats.</p>



<p><br>What is your dream car?</p>



<p>For me, it’s more than a dream of having a particular car. I’m more than happy with the car that I have: a 2017 gray Jeep. I’m even happier that I’m no longer driving a 1991 van: ugly in every way.<br>For me, the Jeep reminds me that things can get better, no matter how I may feel at the moment. It’s also a reminder that my God is my source and my provider. And, because of this, I don’t have to worry about tomorrow.</p>



<p>If I begin to worry, as I am prone to do from time to time, I can go from 0 to panicked in .60 seconds. But, if I keep my eyes on God, and His Word in my heart (mind), there is really nothing to fear.</p>



<p><br>How can we celebrate Collector Car Appreciation Day? It may depend on where you live. If, for example, you live in a rural community, it may be that you or your neighbor has one of these in his or her yard. You may be able find a collector car at a local car dealership. You can also find photos and posters online. And there are car magazines. Finally, there are toy, model and remote control cars.<br></p>



<p>Perhaps, just learning something new is what matters. Personally, I would say that hope is what matters. And, it matters where we put on hope. My hope is in God: the Father, Son and Holly Spirit. Where do you find your hope?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you want to spend time with your friends, and are looking for an excuse to get together, these ideas just may help.</p>



<p>Find a movie that you can watch together. If you like, you can bring the TV outside and watch it in the great outdoors. Rent one of the new releases or find an old classic. Make popcorn or other snacks, and have drinks available.</p>



<p>Maybe you can find some place to go hiking. A long walk and fresh air just may be what you and your friend needs. Bring a camera and/or binoculars and, if you like, you can bring along a bird book or look for other things, like plants or mushrooms.</p>



<p>If crafting is your thing, maybe you can find something to make with your friends. You can use just about anything that you want, from wood to wax, paper to paint. Just about anything that you imagine you can make.</p>



<p>You could also cook something together. You could bake or barbecue, you could go shopping for the ingredients or catch them at a nearby lake or river. You could have an old fashion ice cream social, or tea for two.</p>



<p>Maybe you would rather go for a bicycle ride. You could go for a long or short ride. If you don’t have your own bicycle, some bicycle shops offer rentals that you can get by the hour or by the day.</p>



<p>Perhaps you would rather get together to read one of your favorite books. You can take turns reading, and talking about what you have read. This is something that you can do once, or you can get together on a weekly or monthly basis.<br>If you are musically inclined, maybe you can get together to form a band. This doesn’t mean that you have to record an album or go on tour, but you might be able to preform before a small crowd.</p>



<p>If you have some ideas of your own, please share them. We would be glad to hear our ideas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&#8220;Jesus loves me, this I know.  Just that sometimes, I have to go real slow.&#8221;</p>



<p>The trend has long been to do more, faster and better than before. I think we all feel the pressure in some way to get more done. Yet, even God took a day off.</p>



<p>There are at least a few ways to take a step back from our work. We just have to figure out what works best for us.</p>



<p>Plan ahead to do nothing. It could mean that you plan to set aside a few minutes each day, or it could mean that you plan to take a full day off each week. It also means figuring out what you may need to do or to put off in order to take this time.</p>



<p>By doing nothing, I don’t mean that you have to lie in bed and not move. What I’m talking about may look like one of the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Take a nap.</li>



<li>Call a friend.</li>



<li>Journal.</li>



<li>Pray or pick up a Bible.</li>



<li>Draw, crochet, cook or something else.</li>



<li>Take a leisurely walk.</li>
</ul>



<p>These are just a few ideas. The thing is that some of us — myself included — have to plan things or else they just don’t happen. And, for me, even putting something on a to-do list dues’t guarantee that it will get done.</p>



<p>The thing is to do something that you will enjoy doing. And keep it simple. Don’t think, as I some times do, my neighbor’s lawn needs cleaning, so I’m going to take care of that. Yes, there is a time for these things, but it cannot replace taking at least a little time to replenish ourselves.</p>



<p>Can taking time off be taken to extremes? Yes, everything can. That’s probably why God limited it to one day. And when God gave us 10 commandments, taking time off was just one of them — and not even the first.</p>



<p>We can keep ourselves so busy that we forget what we are doing it for. What we do, we should do out of love. Whether it’s working or taking time to help someone else, cooking, drawing or helping little old ladies across the street, we should do it out of love.</p>



<p>Remember, God loved us so much that He sent His one and only son to die for us so that He could restore a broken relationship between us. Yes, God had to plan ahead. He had to sacrifice something He loved. But He loved us that much.</p>

<p>We call it social media, but does it really help our social life? I saw a post on Facebook that said that our phones were keeping us closer to those who are far away but far from those who are close.</p>



<p>Social media isn’t really to blame for keeping those who are physically close at bay and more than the candy at the store makes me buy it. Social media is, however, designed to be easy to use, as is the candy at the store placed in a way that it is easily found.</p>



<p>Yes, social media can be a way in which we can keep in touch with family and friends who are far away. And as much as we move from place to place, it can be good to stay in touch with those we care about.</p>



<p>One problem with social media is that it allows us to put on sort of a mask that can hide reality. We don’t need social media to do this, but it can make it easier. The truth is that our lives aren’t always exciting — I know that mine isn’t — and our lives don’t always turn out the way that we might have wanted. And it can be easy to paint a false image of how well things are going — on social media or otherwise.</p>



<p>Social media tends to be one dimensional, as well, and lacks the true depth of real life. Sure, real life can be can be complicated, but that doesn’t make it bad. And easy isn’t always the best way.</p>



<p>The best way is to be open and real in our relationships. It might be hard, but it may be worth it. Ideally, one place that we ought to be the most welcome is the church. Unfortunately, all too often, this can sometimes can sometimes be one the hardest places to be open about our struggles.</p>



<p>There is a bright side to social media. With many unable to go to church, many churches have taken to the internet and are at least in part meeting online. It may not be the same as meeting in person, but the truth of God’s word may be reaching more people.</p>



<p>It may be a good idea to take a holiday from our electronics now and then. It’s hard to find group of people together where they aren’t all looking at their phones. I think that our phones and other devices have caused us to forget what it really means to be social.</p>



<p>Don’t be afraid to say hi to others. If you have time, you might even be able to ask someone else how she is doing. The problem is, though, that we are all too busy, and much of this business is due to the time we spend on social media</p>

<p>If you don’t know who Peppa Pig is, ask a five year old. Peppa Pig is a children’s show that starts out with a little pig named Peppa Pig introducing herself and the rest of her family. Her best friend is a rabbit and. It’s a British show that I think can teach us all a few things.</p>



<p><strong>Be respectful</strong><br>Along with trust, respect is among the most important parts of any relationship. It is something that we should show others right away instead of, as some think, that it has to be earned before it can be given.</p>



<p>In order to give respect, however, we have to know what respect is and what is not. And we must first have respect for ourselves. We show respect by understanding that our value comes from our creator. It does not mean giving in to what others want, whatever the cost. It requires trust and honesty and caring for the good of ourselves and of others. To show respect for ourselves and others, we must know when to say “yes” and “no.”</p>



<p><strong>Ask questions</strong><br>Along the same lines as respect, we ought to be able to ask questions. Avoid questions like “Why are you so fat,” and “How could you be such an idiot”. “What do you mean,” and “How did you come to that conclusion” might be better questions. The thing that we want to do is to clarify, to learn more while avoiding making assumptions.</p>



<p><strong>Make up quickly</strong><br>Friends or family may hurt us and sometimes do. Yet, it is almost never done with the intention of causing physical or emotional harm. Avoid cutting off communication. Instead, try to be the first to open up. Talk about your feelings and avoid calling the other person names or attacking someone personally. Just because that person hurt you in some way doesn’t give you permission to hurt them in in return. Your goal is to restore the relationship, not to get even.</p>



<p><strong>Look for ways to help others</strong><br>We all need help at one time or another. Social distancing and pride may make it harder to discover ways that we can help each other, but it’s not impossible. We may be able to find a place where we can volunteer or we may just keep our eyes open to be able to spot some place where we can help.</p>



<p><strong>Have fun</strong><br>Finally, have fun. Find things that you like doing together, even if it’s jumping in muddy puddles. You can always find things that you like doing alone, but try to find things that you enjoy doing with others. And remember “When you jump in muddy puddles, you have to wear your boots.”</p>

<p>I saw an ad online that said “No one can change the world”. It it true? I get their point. What they are trying to say is that no one person can do it alone. Yet, each of us, in our own way can change the world in one way or another. We may not be able to change the whole world, but we can change a small part of it.</p>



<p>Manoj Bhargava has used his billions of dollars that came from the 5-Hour Energy drink to help change the world. He has developed equipment and methods, along with scientists that can help people in rural and poverty stricken areas of the world, places where things like power and fertilizer are hard to come by or can be expensive.</p>



<p>Mother Theresa is well known for all of the things that she did, mainly giving dignity to the dying in India in God’s name. She helped individuals, along with the others who worked with her, that no one else would help.</p>



<p>Steve Jobs used technology to help so many with disabilities to make lives easier for so many, especially those with disabilities. The Apple watch, which the company that he founded, has even been credited with saving lives.</p>



<p>The guy who made individual cups of coffee possible through those little containers change the world. I heard that he regrets his invention do to all the plastic that is now being thrown away, but some times one invention leads to another.</p>



<p>Numerous people have tried to change the world in one way another: through charities, civil and governmental organizations as well as in churches. Some people write books while others teach others how they can change their own lives. But whether we know thousands of people or just a few, whether we age able to do a lot or just a little, each of us, in our own way, can change the world.</p>



<p>Jesus changed the world. No, he didn’t work alone either. But he did something that no one else could have done. He came down from Heaven and lived a perfect life. Jesus fulfilled all of the promises of a coming Messiah, dying on the cross and rising again. Those who believe on him are promised eternal life. Jesus can no only change the world in this lifetime, but he can change our eternity.</p>



<p>Some times this life can seem to go on forever. In God’s eyes, our lives are just a vapor, a puff of smoke when compared to eternity. The lives that we live now may seem like they will continue to go on, that the good will stay or that the problems that we have won’t go away. But this life that we live does eventually come to an end. After that, what? Jesus promises eternal life to those who put their faith in him. Can anyone else say that?</p>
