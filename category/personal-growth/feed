<p>Do you want some good news? I think it’s good, tough you are welcome to disagree.</p>



<p>Deuteronomy 23: 35-36 (KJV) says, “To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste. For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.”</p>



<p>You know what this means? For me, it means I don’t need to judge others or worry about doing so. And, really, I have desire to judge others. It’s too hard to tell who is telling the truth and who is lying. It’s too hard to tell the motives for any given acton. It’s nearly impossible to walk in someone else’s shoes.</p>



<p>No, I don’t know way I do many of the things that I do. So how can I expect myself to be able to understand why others do the things that they do? Answer: I cannot.</p>



<p>Say, for example, I have two children. Say that the two get into a fight and, when confronted, each blames the other. It would be a mistake to choose one over the other, but that is the tendency. Instead, both should be equally punished. Right?</p>



<p>Perhaps, or perhaps not. Maybe the best thing to do would be to help the two to find a way to work it out: to mediate a deal between the two. Far above what punishment could do, this could be a true life lesson.</p>



<p>I don’t know about you, but I am all too quick to judge other’s motives or intent. And, when I do, it can have lasting and negative effects on me and on my relationships.</p>



<p>There is, however, one thing that we can do. We can be open with each other. If something bothers us, we can say, this thing that you are doing makes me uncomfortable. It hurts me when you…..</p>



<p>We should avoid saying things like, “You are a bad person,” and “I don’t like you.” These are things that probably aren’t true, or may be true for a short time. Really, “I don’t like you” is just a way of saying “I’m mad, or sad, or both.”</p>



<p>Instead of judging, I can listen. I can ask questions and try to figure out what went wrong. I can also offer possible solutions. If a fix to the problem is found, great. If not, it may take more time. If no solution is found, maybe one person or the other just don’t want to admit that he or she may be wrong. But, again, it’s not possible for me to know with 100% certainty. Only God knows, and only God can judge the heart.</p>



<p>“Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, ‘Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord’” — Romans 12:19 (KJV)</p>



<p>What do I take away from this? I can and should be more patient — with myself and with others. I don’t need to judge others or their motives. I don’t even really need to judge my own motives. Now, if I need help with a matter, I should find out the best person to talk to. If I need medical advise, I should talk to a doctor. If I need to know how to spell a work, I find that Google works well. If I’m part of a fight, I should realize that I am part of the problem. And when I come to this realization, I should stop, step back and ask, “What is the real problem?”</p>



<p>What do you think? I think that this is good news. But you are welcome to disagree.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Who am I to write about the heart of God? Who do I think I am? Oh, but it’s not really about me. It’s about God.</p>



<p>You may think of it this way. You are entering an intersection and you see a stop sigh. You may stop at that stop sign, or you may decide simply to slow down. After all, there are other cars approaching the intersection, and simply slowing down seems okay. You don’t say to the stop sign, “What right have you to tell me what to do.” It’s simply a sign.</p>



<p>Say, now, that you are entering another intersection. This time, however, there is a clearly marked, clearly visible police car parked near this intersection. I would venture to guess that you (and I) would be more careful to make sure that we stopped at that stop sigh.</p>



<p>Do I know everything about God? Certainly not. Nor can I know everything about you, partly because I don’t have all the answers regarding my own life. Yet, I walk in a relationship with the living God, not because of anything that I have done, but because of the things that God has done. I, by no means feel worthy to write about the heart of God, but I believe that He has put this on my heart. So, it is by faith that I begin writing. And I am trusting God, though His Spirit, to guide me each step along the way as to what I should and should not write.</p>



<p>No, I’m not a stop sign and this material is not designed to make or even to help you stop doing something. Rather, think of it as one of those signs that point you to the highway that you need to take, the gas station where you need to stop or to the hospital that you need to visit. As with any sign, we all need help getting to the place(s) that we need to go. I believe that God gives us signs — that all of creation is one big sign pointing to Him. I also believe that God gave us His written word, the Bible, to point us to Him. And that is what I will base my writing on.</p>



<p>You may or may not agree with the things that I write. However, like the stop sign, I do not care what you may think of me. But the one in the police car may care what you do.</p>



<p>Don’t get me wrong. God is not waiting for us to mess up so that He can punish us. The truth is that we all have a problem called sin and death. This sin, because of who we are and who God is, separates us from God. God could have said, “Oh, well, they get what they deserve.” But that is not the heart of God. God would not and could not simply let us perish. He loves us too much to let that happen.</p>



<p>There is much that I will not write about. After many years of study and just plain listing to others, I am certainly ware of many of the different views on everything from creation to eschatology (the study of end times). My goal is not to show you that I am right. My goal is simply to let you know or, perhaps to remind you, that God loves you, whoever you are or however you may see yourself.</p>



<p>John 3: 16 (KJV) tells us, “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</p>



<p>Oh, I still have questions. And there have certainly been times when I’ve had doubts — even about the love of God in my life. There have even been times when I felt as if I were on of God’s “Oops — how did that get through?” Trust me, my life is no mistake and neither is yours.</p>



<p>I hope this writing is a blessing: a blessing for both you and for me. By this, I don’t mean that God will give us the riches that we desire in this life but that we will be blessed riches of a relationship with the living God — the only one who can give us eternal life. Don’t break out the hats for the pity-party just yet. God has a plan for each of us, for this life and beyond. God loves you and me; that’s reason to celebrate.</p>

<p>Comparison really isn’t a good thing, unless you are comparing yourself to what you used to be like. And hopefully, you can see an improvement that has taken place over time.</p>



<p>The biggest change in my life happened when I put my faith in Jesus and asked Him into my life. I was just 14 at the time but I knew that I needed God to come into my life to begin making changes. Some things changed right away, while other changes have taken more time.</p>



<p>My most recent job required a lot of changes. I had been in food service for most of my career but found myself in manufacturing. I’ve been in my new job just over two years now and I can look back at all of the lessons that I’ve learned along the way.</p>



<p>I can look at my photography and, thought I thought I was pretty good to begin with, my skill level has come closer to what I thought it was at when I started.</p>



<p>My typing ability has greatly improved since I first began typing, but my hand writing isn’t as good. My skills as an artist have also declined with lack of practice.</p>



<p>We can track some of our progress by keeping a journal or a scrapbook. Some progress is harder to keep track of. And some times it seems that I’m moving backwards when, in reality, it’s probably my target is moving further down the road. It’s pretty common that, as we get better at something, our goal also shifts.</p>



<p>If you’re just starting something, you may want to keep a journal or a scrapbook. If you’re wanting to paint or draw, try to keep your first picture so you can compare it with your most recent work. Hopefully, you can see an improvement. And try to avoid comparing yourself with others.</p>

<p>Let me tell you the story of a young man. You may know him. After becoming a Christian, he left his church because he was afraid that he might be called on to pray.</p>



<p>Speaking in front of others: out of the question.<br>Rating the Bible to others: a total embarrassment.</p>



<p>It took all of the courage he had to approach the photo editor at the local newspaper to submit a photo for publication, after which he would receive a check in the mail for $5.</p>



<p>All too often, this young boy was told that being a photographer is too hard. Thought his adolescence, he was told that his work just wasn’t good enough. Even after his work began to improve, he still had trouble seeing it in himself. This failure to see his present reality led him to give up time after time with little or no effort.</p>



<p>This young boy — someone who could have easily passed for someone at least 5 years younger — was so shy. The product of a broken home and a broken educational system, he couldn’t even pray out loud to ask Jesus into his heart. Yet, he knew, somehow, that God heard him.</p>



<p>All this young boy wanted was to take pictures. And, in spite of overhang, he would walk 20 minutes to the athletic department at the local university. It was a path that he had walked often, and he could remember, not only the beer cans that litter the fraternity lawns, but the old school building that piqued his curiosity. You may not know this, but this young boy waited up to an hour for a chance to get a press pass to photograph various sporting events. You may not know that this young boy had a nervous tick in his feet that caused him to rub his toes together until they became raw.</p>



<p>You may not know the impact that you have on a young man — until we reach Heaven and God — Jesus — comes to you and says, “Well done, good and faithful servant.” You see, some live their whole our lives, waiting for Jesus to tell them these words, while many will only hear, “Depart from me, I never knew you.”</p>



<p>I want to be the one whom Jesus meets with a proud smile, gives me a huge hug, and tells me He loves me. I want to be the young man who grew up to be brave and always looking for the bright side: the reason to give praise. I want to be the one who is always looking for ways to help others — the ones who really need it. Like me.</p>



<p>You see, God rally does pay attention, and it is the little things that he sees.</p>



<p>If there is something that you want to do, go for it. You will probably make mistakes along the way, but that’s how we learn. You may just find that the path your are on is not the one that you want to stay on, but that is part of learning, too. The main thing is that you don’t give up — on yourself or on others. Keep going, and you will find where you are meant to go.</p>

<p>The things that I do today, the things that I do every day, especially the things that I do first thing in the morning are key to determining my future. What I do really does matter. Today, I plant the seeds that I will reap in the tomorrows to come. So, what is it that I do, or at least try to do first thing in the morning?</p>



<p>First, I read a bible verse. Psalm 143: 8 (KJV) says, “Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.”</p>



<p>I drink water, or lemon water, which helps refresh the bodies fluids.</p>



<p>I take vitamin D or a multi vitamin which can help mood in addition to having other health benefits.</p>



<p>I also listen to music. Right now, I’m listening to Audrey Assad. It’s calming and helps me to remember what really matters — a relationship with the living God.</p>



<p>Finally, I remember what I am thankful for: past, present and things to come.</p>



<p>This is what I do first thing. I also write, go for a walk and often take pictures. What is it that you could do first thing in the morning to help you get off to a good start? If you like, you can comment below.</p>

<p>I was reading that a local pastor had decided to back a local semi-pro team until he discovered that they were going to sell beer at the events. It must have been a touch decision. But the pastor stuck by his decision and that is commendable.</p>



<p>It can be hard to stick by our decisions, especially if someone we care about is trying to get us to change our mind. I remember someone trying to get me to smoke for the first time. It wasn’t a hard decision to choose not to smoke, but what if it had been a close friend. The choice would have been much harder.</p>



<p>Look at Samson and the choice that he had with Delilah. That must have been tough. In fact, Samson compared Delilah and her nagging to a constant dripping.</p>



<p>The problem is that, if we give in in are of our lives, it can be easier to compromise in other areas. One thing can lead to another and another. Before we know it we are doing things that we never intended to do.</p>



<p>It’s best if we can to know our boundaries and stop there. If we can, we may need to move our boundaries to in so that we are better equipped to avoid the things that we should. And, if you can, let others know where your boundaries stand. It will help you and it will help them know how to relate better to you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It seems that there is always something that can keep us busy. If it’s not work and paying the bills, it’s something else: taking care of others, or just living life.</p>



<p>Staying busy can help pass the time, and help us to forget that our lives may have not turned out exactly as we had hoped. But it can also keep us from discovering some of the more important things that matter not only in this life but in eternity.</p>



<p>The Gospel of Luke tells us a story of how Martha wanted Jesus to tell Mary to help with the meal preparations. Now, Mary was sitting at the feet of Jesus, spending time with him and his disciples. And when Martha asked for help, Jesus said that Mary had chosen something that really mattered.</p>



<p>We may also have times when we will choose between things that will keep us busy, or the things that really matter: our relationship with our God and our relationship with family and friends.</p>



<p>There are going to be times when the need seems so great that we cannot take the time to pray or read the Bible. And we may be too busy working at our jobs or doing things around the house to take spend time with those we love.</p>



<p>Yet, it’s important that we make the time. God though it important enough that He set aside a full day to do nothing but spend time with Him. Opportunities lost may not come around a second time, so it’s important to use the opportunities that we have wisely. Staying busy can be a good thing, but don’t exchange good for what’s best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Trying to get tech to work can seem like getting a three year old to clean up his room.&nbsp; Yet, tech doesn’t have the advantage of being loved, which makes it all the more frustrating when we can’t get it to do what we want. &nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t know about you, but my frustrations range from phones that mysteriously turn on, open an app and begin doing whatever it pleases.&nbsp; Usually, I can tell that my phone is on because it warms up in my pocket.&nbsp; By the time I notice it, however, the batter has drained half its power.</p>



<p>Software can be another problem. While Adobe offers some of the best software, it can also be some of the most frustrating.&nbsp; Presently, I’m trying to get my computer connected to the internet, but its being very trying. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Love is so important; it should be included in the list of things that we need in order to survive.&nbsp; Like water, air and shelter, love might just be key to survival.&nbsp; And though it may not be necessary for every individual, it is for the survival of the human race. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, we can survive without love, but we cannot thrive without it.&nbsp; And though we can just survive, the better option is to thrive. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Can we find love if and when we are alone?&nbsp; I think so.&nbsp; Why, you may ask? &nbsp; Or, how?&nbsp; It’s simple.&nbsp; If you can find someone else who needs love and, if you are willing to be open and vulnerable, you can find love. &nbsp;</p>



<p>First Corinthians 13 reminds us that, if we don’t have love, our actions, our very lives are useless.&nbsp; For the Bible tells us that God, Himself, is love.&nbsp; We love because He first loved us. &nbsp;</p>



<p>If love is so important, how do we find it?&nbsp; First, search for God.&nbsp; You can “ask Him into your heart.”&nbsp; It’s kind of like giving God your heart.&nbsp; God already owns everything.&nbsp; We just have to surrender our will to His. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, we can decide to meet others where they are.&nbsp; Activity look to help others, meeting then where they are and not where we wish they were.&nbsp; God met us where we were when He sent Jesus to die on a cross.&nbsp; We meet Him when we accept His gift.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jesus loves me, this I know.  Just that sometimes, I have to go real slow.&#8221;</p>



<p>The trend has long been to do more, faster and better than before. I think we all feel the pressure in some way to get more done. Yet, even God took a day off.</p>



<p>There are at least a few ways to take a step back from our work. We just have to figure out what works best for us.</p>



<p>Plan ahead to do nothing. It could mean that you plan to set aside a few minutes each day, or it could mean that you plan to take a full day off each week. It also means figuring out what you may need to do or to put off in order to take this time.</p>



<p>By doing nothing, I don’t mean that you have to lie in bed and not move. What I’m talking about may look like one of the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Take a nap.</li>



<li>Call a friend.</li>



<li>Journal.</li>



<li>Pray or pick up a Bible.</li>



<li>Draw, crochet, cook or something else.</li>



<li>Take a leisurely walk.</li>
</ul>



<p>These are just a few ideas. The thing is that some of us — myself included — have to plan things or else they just don’t happen. And, for me, even putting something on a to-do list dues’t guarantee that it will get done.</p>



<p>The thing is to do something that you will enjoy doing. And keep it simple. Don’t think, as I some times do, my neighbor’s lawn needs cleaning, so I’m going to take care of that. Yes, there is a time for these things, but it cannot replace taking at least a little time to replenish ourselves.</p>



<p>Can taking time off be taken to extremes? Yes, everything can. That’s probably why God limited it to one day. And when God gave us 10 commandments, taking time off was just one of them — and not even the first.</p>



<p>We can keep ourselves so busy that we forget what we are doing it for. What we do, we should do out of love. Whether it’s working or taking time to help someone else, cooking, drawing or helping little old ladies across the street, we should do it out of love.</p>



<p>Remember, God loved us so much that He sent His one and only son to die for us so that He could restore a broken relationship between us. Yes, God had to plan ahead. He had to sacrifice something He loved. But He loved us that much.</p>

<p>Is there something that you wanted to learn but just haven’t been able to do? For a time, I wanted to learn how to knit. Or was it crochet? I get the two mixed up. I tried for a while, but couldn’t get past the first row.</p>



<p>Some times, what we need is a little more practice. It can take time to develop muscle memory, and some things may come easier than others. I hated my typing class. Someone told me, years ago, that he used typing nearly every day. Now, I’m using typing every day.</p>



<p>Other times, we just need the right teacher to come along. I loved art class in elementary school, but I didn’t do very well until I got a teacher that knew what she was doing. Trust me, a good teacher can make all of the difference.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, unless our job requires it, we tend to give up on the creative part of us after graduating from school. We probably all use our creative side in one way or another, though, it’s likely that we reserve it for problem solving.</p>



<p>I’ve been taking pictures for over 40 years and it is unlikely that I will ever stop, though my picture taking does slow down at times. These days, I’m doing more writing than I am taking pictures. It wasn’t something that I planned. It just happened that way.</p>



<p>It’s been a while since I’ve had any writing classes. I have listened to a few audio books on the subject. Mostly, I just wrote. This is mostly how I learned photography, and how I learned how to use a computer. I just did it, learning from my mistakes and going on.</p>



<p>It helps to have a teacher, especially if you want to get really good at something. You can find teachers online or in person, in books, magazines and on video. The advantage to having a real person teaching you is that you can get feedback on your work. But you may also learn by just jumping in and doing whatever it is that you want to learn.</p>



<p>If you want to learn photography, I know of no better way than to just go out and start taking pictures. I started out with a camera, shooting film. These days, I take most of my pictures with my phone.</p>



<p>Study composition and look closely at the work of other photographers to see what they might be doing. Try different angles and different lighting. Different filters can also be a big help when it comes to getting better pictures.</p>



<p>If you want to learn how to draw, get some books on the subject. Don’t worry if your first picture is a stick figure or doesn’t look as good as you might want. Don’t compare yourself with others, but compare this year’s work with last years. If you continue to practice, you will get better.</p>
