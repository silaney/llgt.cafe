<p>Do you want more friends? I know that there are times when I do. Here are four ideas that may help.</p>



<p>Try going somewhere new: some place you haven’t been before or, perhaps, haven’t been in a while. It may be a library, a church, a coffee shop, a store or some other place. Try going some place where you might see someone you may know but haven’t seen for a long time.</p>



<p>If there are others around, try introducing yourself. You can tell someone else your name and ask theirs. You can add a little humor, too. Recently, I introduced myself saying, “I’m not running for the office of president, so please don’t vote for me.” You can also ask questions, like “What is your favorite color,” or “If you could go anywhere in the world, where would you go?”</p>



<p>Questions are also a good way to deepen a relationship. Just don’t move ahead of the conversation into uncharted territories too quickly. Unless you know someone well enough, it may not be a good idea to ask personal questions. It may be better to ask simple questions and build other questions based on the response that you receive.</p>



<p>Finally, remember things about the person that you want to know better. It may just be his or her name for starters. If that person has a wife or husband or children, find out their names and try to remember them. I worked at a place where we all had different days off and there were several people who I could remember when their weekends was coming up; I would wish each of them a happy Friday.</p>



<p>These are just a few things that you can do to find new friends and help build relationships. Real relationships require familiarity and that takes time. Don’t be afraid to take the first step. Who knows, your next best friend could be around the corner.</p>

<p>August is Family Fun Month. If you haven’t already made plans and if you still have time before school starts, there’s still time to celebrate. If you don’t already have plans, it would probably be a good idea to stay local, meaning, this may not be a good time to start booking flights for this weekend. Here are some ideas:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Find the closest museum. There are a few near and not so near me and some of them are free. There is at least one art museum, an air museum and the U of A has a museum that is within walking distance from where I live.</li>



<li>You may be able to find a concert that you are interested in. It could be at a huge auditorium or at a local bar/pub. Personally, I would rather hear live music at a pub. Either way, I recommend that you make sure that the music is suitable for everyone who will be going.</li>



<li>Go to a lake or to the ocean. This isn’t really for me — not until the weather starts cooling down — but you might enjoy it. You may want to arrive early but that’s up to you.</li>



<li>Find a movie that everyone might enjoy. Or there may be a play in your area that you might be interested in. Christian Youth Theater, CYT, and other organizations, put on plays on a regular basis. You can check your local listings.</li>



<li>Have a game day. It could be board games, charades or something like Tic-Tac-Toe. There’s also Simon Says and countless other games. Solitaire works, too.</li>
</ul>



<p>Whatever you decide to do, have fun. And feel free to share your story in the comments below. Thanks and have a happy Family Fun Month.</p>
