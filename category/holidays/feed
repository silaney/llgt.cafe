<p>Today is National Cuban Sandwich Day. It is observed annually on August 23. Apparently, started as “fake news,” National Cuban Sandwich Day later became a real holiday, celebrating the Cuban sandwich, which was first made some time around 1870 or 1880. It is a traditional sandwich of Cuba and made its way to the the US by way of southern Florida.</p>



<p>Though there are many variations, the traditional Cuban sandwich is made using Cuban bread, ham or pork, cheese and pickles. The bread is coated with a thin layer of oil and it hot pressed.</p>



<p>There are numerous recipes online, if you want to make your own, of you can see if a local sandwich shop makes them. The sandwiches themselves range from simple to gourmet.</p>



<p>Today is also Buttered Corn Day, which is also observed each year on August 23. If you have corn on the cob or can get some, after cooking it, or perhaps as part of the cooking process, make sure to add butter. Maybe you can have some corn with your Cuban sandwich.</p>



<p>Finally, today is National Sponge Cake Day. Sponge cake can be served alone or with toppings. You may be able to purchase some from a local bakery or you can find a recipe online. Either way, it would make an excellent dessert.</p>

<p>Today is World Photo Day, which has been observed annually since 2010. The world’s first photograph was taken with a camera in 1826 by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce. Today, photographers are encouraged to share at least one photo on social media in honor of World Photo Day. It is to be a photo that depicts their world.</p>



<p>Below are some of my favorite pictures that I’ve taken over the years. I hope you enjoy them and remember to share your photos as well. Have a happy World Photo Day.</p>

<p>Judy: What kind of jobs do most dogs work?<br>Frank: I don’t know, what kind of jobs do most dogs work?<br>Judy: Roofing.</p>



<p>Today is National Bowling Day. And though I haven’t been bowling in many years, I have enjoyed bowling in the past.</p>



<p>It seems to me if you are a pro-bowler, then every day is a good day to bowl. If you are like me, you have to wait for someone to invite you to go bowling. Maybe you are somewhere in between and you go bowling a few times a year.</p>



<p>I think that the last time I bowled was at least five years ago and was related to a company party.</p>



<p>If you are one of those in the middle, consider inviting others to go bowling with you. If you have family, invite them. Bowling can be a lot of fun. Let me know what you think in the comments below. Thanks and have a great National Bowling Day, whatever you choose to do.</p>

<p>August is Family Fun Month. If you haven’t already made plans and if you still have time before school starts, there’s still time to celebrate. If you don’t already have plans, it would probably be a good idea to stay local, meaning, this may not be a good time to start booking flights for this weekend. Here are some ideas:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Find the closest museum. There are a few near and not so near me and some of them are free. There is at least one art museum, an air museum and the U of A has a museum that is within walking distance from where I live.</li>



<li>You may be able to find a concert that you are interested in. It could be at a huge auditorium or at a local bar/pub. Personally, I would rather hear live music at a pub. Either way, I recommend that you make sure that the music is suitable for everyone who will be going.</li>



<li>Go to a lake or to the ocean. This isn’t really for me — not until the weather starts cooling down — but you might enjoy it. You may want to arrive early but that’s up to you.</li>



<li>Find a movie that everyone might enjoy. Or there may be a play in your area that you might be interested in. Christian Youth Theater, CYT, and other organizations, put on plays on a regular basis. You can check your local listings.</li>



<li>Have a game day. It could be board games, charades or something like Tic-Tac-Toe. There’s also Simon Says and countless other games. Solitaire works, too.</li>
</ul>



<p>Whatever you decide to do, have fun. And feel free to share your story in the comments below. Thanks and have a happy Family Fun Month.</p>

<p>Did you know that today is National Gossip Day and that gossip can help you or your business make money? It’s true. I just wrote it, so it must be true.</p>



<p>No. Seriously, rumors and gossip don’t actually help you or your business make money. Quite the opposite is true; rumors and gossip can hurt your finances.</p>



<p>Mainly, gossip can cause you to make the wrong financial choices. Rather than knowing what is really going on, it’s possible to get inaccurate information from various sources. I don’t know how many times the stock market was going to crash — and it didn’t. I don’t know how many times banks were doomed and yet banks still exist. Predicting a market or a financial crash is like predicting the next “great” quake to hit California. Even when you think you know, you really don’t know.</p>



<p>Someone may say, “this business has done well in the past, so they are certain to do well in the future.” This may lead us to buy their stocks: stocks that may be doomed to go down because of information that I have not been given. When it comes to advise on buying stocks — or anything else — it’s best to get more than one opinion. For example, I no longer buy supplements on Amazon without getting more than one opinion.</p>



<p>How do we know what is a rumor or just plain gossip? It can be hard to tell. One way to know is if someone has to whisper it. Another way is if someone uses works like “could” or “might” but makes it sound more like “will”: this will help you make more money or will help you live a healthier life.</p>



<p>I remember seeing an add for magnesium that said that this product helped someone sleep much better. After buying magnesium from another source, I watched a YouTube video that said it can help a limited number of people. It seems that I wasn’t one of them. I didn’t spend a lot of money and I can still use the product. But it certainly hasn’t helped me sleep better.</p>



<p>Finally, rumors and gossip can hurt you, your relationships and your business. You may not be able to keep others from spreading rumors about you, but you can put an end to a rumor that goes your way.</p>



<p>In the end, gossip is no good and it can do nothing but hurt others, whether it be financially or personally. The Bible clearly warns against spreading rumors for that very reason. So, if you are tempted to spread gossip about someone, stop, and consider how you might feel if someone said the same thing about you.</p>

<p>Today is Work Like a Dog Day. And though there are no prescribed ways to celebrate, here are a few ideas:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Work harder than you would normally work. Don’t just bark orders, work. Work hard in honor of those who normally put 100% effort into all that they do.</li>



<li>Work like a dog: that is, take a nap, lie in the shade or on the couch.  A hammock works great, too.</li>



<li>Give your service dog a day off or, perhaps, a special treat.</li>



<li>Take your dog to a dog park.<br>Take yourself to a dog park and let your dog come along.</li>



<li>If you don’t have a dog, maybe it’s time to get one. There is probably a local pet adoption agency that you can contact in order to find a dog.</li>



<li>Borrow someone else’s dog for the day. Maybe you have a friend or a relative who wouldn’t mind letting you borrow his or her dog for the day. The two of you can go for a walk, take naps together or, maybe, go for a swim at the lake.</li>
</ul>



<p>Whatever you decided to do, enjoy. If you take one of my suggestions or come up with one of your own, please let me know.</p>

<p>August is American Artist Appreciation Month. Do you have any favorite artists? I do. But I must say that some of my favorite artist are from Canada. Sarah McLachlan, Marie-Louise Gay and Ann Marie McDonald are just a few. But I really like the work of David Burnett, an American Photographer known for photographing subjects from presidents to Olympians. Here are a few more of my favorite (and some other well known) American artists.</p>



<p>Norman Rockwell, born February 3, 1894 in New York City, died November 8, 1978 in Stockbridge, MA at the age of 84. Rockwell was best known for his painting and illustrations depicting American life, especially for his work for The Saturday Evening Post.</p>



<p>Georgia O’Keefe, born November 15, 1887 in Sun Prairie, WI and died March 6, 1986 in Santa Fe, NM. Her work was primarily American modern, now graces some of the world’s greatest art collections.</p>



<p>Jacob Lawrence was born September 7, 1917 in Atlantic City, NY and died June 9 2000 in Seattle, WA. Calling his work “dynamic cubism”, Lawrence was best known for his depictions of African-American history.</p>



<p>These are just a few artists. My favorite art forms — the things that I do best, include writing, cooking and photography. These are things that I enjoy doing for myself and for others to (perhaps) enjoy.</p>



<p>What form of art do you enjoy and who are your favorite artists? Please comment below. Thanks.</p>

<p>Share a Hug Day</p>



<p>It’s tragic. A man returning home from vacation was hit by a truck that failed to stop and his wife and one of his two sons were killed in the accident. Yet, even out of tragedy, we can find reason to celebrate life.</p>



<p>Share a Hug Day, it seems, was born out of that tragedy. Though it cannot be assumed that everyone feels comfortable receiving a hug, it should be okay to ask. If the other person is okay being hugged, hug away.</p>



<p>By the way, hugs are good medicine.</p>

<p>“<strong>Children are an heritage of the Lord” — Psalm 127:3</strong></p>



<p>Happy Aunt and Uncles Day. So, if my sister has a son, that makes me an uncle. If, instead, she has a daughter, does that make me an aunt? Just kidding.</p>



<p>If you happen to make it to Spokane, Washington, there is an amazing bookstore called Aunties. You should go if you have a chance.</p>



<p>If you have a niece for nephew, don’t bother trying to get them to mow the lawn with you. It may work but probably won’t. Instead, take them out to eat or to a movie of their choosing. You may want to read to him or her. Just have fun together.</p>
