										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Amelia Earhart was born on July 24, 1897. If she’s still alive, she would be 127 years old. Unfortunately her plane disappeared and Mrs. Earhart is presumed dead. Today is Amelia Earhart Day. And, though we could celebrate with cake and ice cream, there might be other ways to celebrate this day.</p>



<p>First, we could study the life of Mrs. Earhart, who was born in Kansas and grew up to do what women in her days dared not do. She entered a man’s world of flying and conquered it. Unfortunately, the plane that set her free probably took her life. But what’s worse, to die trying or to never attempt to do what you feel you were born to do? Each of us has to answer that for ourselves.</p>



<p>Second, we can make paper airplanes and fly them. If there’s more than one person, we can compete to see whose airplane flys the furthers or stays in the air the longest.</p>



<p>Third, we can watch a documentary on Amelia Earhart. I’m sure there is something on iTunes or, at least YouTube.</p>



<p>Finally and, perhaps, more importantly, we can follow our dream, wherever it leads. Is there something that you’ve wanted to do but have been too afraid to do it? Maybe you just haven’t found the time. I don’t mean cleaning the dishes or folding the clothes. It may mean saying “Hi” to that someone you’ve been afraid to talk to. It may mean taking a flight to some place you’ve always wanted to go. Or it may just be time to check into the price of flights. Today might be the day to take that first step.</p>



<p>Faith comes to mind. Faith is the belief in something that we cannot see or that hasn’t happened yet. It says that, if I do something, I’ll be okay or safe and that it might make me happier. Fear says that I’m going to die if I do my laundry or as a girl out to a movie. It’s your choice: choose faith.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The power went out some time after 7:30 AM. I found out some time around 8 AM. It seems that the rain caused a tree limb to droop down low enough to hit a power line.</p>



<p>It’s an easy fix for the power company. But if I hadn’t seen the power company truck, I would not have known.</p>



<p>What if the power weren’t back on. What would I do if the power outage were more widespread? After a tornado hit neighboring towns a little over 2 years ago, the place where I work lost power for three days.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I have backup lights, and that’s a good place to start. But that’s only a start. I can’t make my instant coffee and, if the power were still out, I wouldn’t want to open my fridge.</p>



<p>So, what is it that I need if the power goes out for an extended time — say, a week or more?</p>



<p>Light<br>Light comes in handy. And, if you have light, it helps to see what you are doing. Along with that is the batteries to power that light.</p>



<p>Water<br>Water may be next, if the water fails to run. LifeStraws are also a good source of clean water. They filter water that is not drinkable and makes it drinkable.</p>



<p>Sheler<br>Assuming that there is no structural damage, as in an earthquake or tornado, some form of protection from the heat or cold may be needed. A battery powered fan may be useful. Extra blankets can also help; sleeping bags work, too.</p>



<p>Food<br>Canned goods may be important. Try to stick with things that you know that you will use, whether in an emergency or not. If you won’t eat it before it expires, you probably shouldn’t buy it.</p>



<p>Planning<br>This includes making plans of what to do if the power goes out. You may check to see if there is still radio. If there is, great. If not, wait. Phone service may or may not work. Check the weather to see if it is raining. You may also check to see if anyone else is without power. If they have power, it’s likely that the problem is in your home or apartment. If you know your neighbors, you may be able to help them with their needs.</p>



<p>Planning can help with a lot of issues in an emergency, such as a power outage. But it can’t solve every issue that might arise. I find that prayer goes a long way, too. In an emergency, teamwork goes much further. It’s a win-win situation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today is National Personal Chef Day</p>



<p>This is exciting. Whether you currently have a personal chef or you can barely afford your next meal, this day is for you.</p>



<p>No, really. Having a personal chef may be a great idea and, if you are thinking about hiring one, the prices may be better than you thought. If another PBJ sandwich seems on the horizon, this information could help.</p>



<p>If you want the services of a personal chef, these tips could help.</p>



<p>Figure out a budget. Is your food budget $10, $100, or $1,000? It’s important to know. And, if need be, you can use cash.</p>



<p>Collecting coupons may help reduce the cost of groceries. I find basic ingredients — eggs, flour, milk and such — work best. Add a few ingredients, and there are so many things that you can make.</p>



<p>Plan your meals, based on simple recipes. The simpler the foods, the more likely you are to stick to the plan. Some things, like a dry pancake mix, can be made up ahead of time. A planner may come in handy, where you can plan a shopping day as well as menu options.</p>



<p>Note: it’s better to have extra options instead of having too few and having to go back to the store to buy one or two items (snacks).</p>



<p>Here are some options:<br>Oatmeal<br>Ground beef<br>Burger Buns<br>Carrots (cooked or uncooked)<br>Noodles<br>Soups<br>Mixed Greens</p>



<p>These are just a few things that you can buy. The thing to remember is to buy according to the menu plan and to the budget. Keep in mind that food often costs more than we expect. It may be better to overestimate the cost of food.</p>



<p>One helpful purchase might be containers. You can portion out food and place it in storage: the pantry, fridge or freezer. If you like, you can either label these containers with “Use By” dates, the name of the item, or the date and meal that you intend to use it. Some things freeze well, while others don’t. Some things, like mixed greens, may need to be made into a salad at the last minute.</p>



<p>So many recipes are available online. If you are in the mood for chicken, see if you can buy chicken in bulk, even if you have to portion it out and freeze it. Just don’t do as I did once and leave it out overnight. Oops.</p>



<p>Keep a running list of groceries and, remember, you don’t have to buy everything on the list: just what you absolutely need and can afford. Soup may mean canned, or fresh ingredients for the same.</p>



<p>These tips from a person chef wanna-be are free and could save you a lot of money. Of course, you can also go out to eat. Restaurants these days are struggling. Just don’t make it your job to keep them in business.</p>



<p>Let me know your ideas. Thanks, in advance.</p>

<p>Today is Collector Car Appreciation Day. Try saying that three times fast.<br>It’s not just about old or fancy and unique cars. A while industry has been built around the automobile. Globally, revenue from just the sale of cars, themselves, was about $31.5 billon, with a growth rate of about 8%. That’s a lot of money and outdoes most stocks on the US Stock Exchange.</p>



<p><br>Aside from the cars, there is petrol, oil changes, car washes, hotel stays, advertising fees, photographers and models. It all adds up, and this money goes out to local businesses.<br>My dream car is a Mercedes, convertible from the early 1980s. I will probably never own one, but it’s nice to dream. It would likely be deep blue with brown leather seats.</p>



<p><br>What is your dream car?</p>



<p>For me, it’s more than a dream of having a particular car. I’m more than happy with the car that I have: a 2017 gray Jeep. I’m even happier that I’m no longer driving a 1991 van: ugly in every way.<br>For me, the Jeep reminds me that things can get better, no matter how I may feel at the moment. It’s also a reminder that my God is my source and my provider. And, because of this, I don’t have to worry about tomorrow.</p>



<p>If I begin to worry, as I am prone to do from time to time, I can go from 0 to panicked in .60 seconds. But, if I keep my eyes on God, and His Word in my heart (mind), there is really nothing to fear.</p>



<p><br>How can we celebrate Collector Car Appreciation Day? It may depend on where you live. If, for example, you live in a rural community, it may be that you or your neighbor has one of these in his or her yard. You may be able find a collector car at a local car dealership. You can also find photos and posters online. And there are car magazines. Finally, there are toy, model and remote control cars.<br></p>



<p>Perhaps, just learning something new is what matters. Personally, I would say that hope is what matters. And, it matters where we put on hope. My hope is in God: the Father, Son and Holly Spirit. Where do you find your hope?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>July 4 is National Barbecue Day, and there’s no better time to learn some of the terms that pit-masters (people skilled in the art of cooking in a barbecue pit) use.</p>



<p><strong>Barbecue</strong><br>Barbecue varies from country to country and in different regions of the United States. The term describes a dry heat cooing method that uses some sort of flame to cook meats over a long period of time. Barbecues very from campfire cooking in that the flame is usually contained to a grill, and the food is cooked directly over the flame.</p>



<p><strong>Baste</strong><br>Brushing liquid such as drippings or other liquids on the meat as it cooks is called basting, and helps keep the meat from drying out.</p>



<p><strong>Basting Brush</strong><br>A basing brush is a bush used to baste meats. You want something designed for food use that will not loose its bristles on the food.</p>



<p><strong>Black and Blue</strong><br>Meat that is cooked quickly, charring the meat on the outside while leaving it rare the inside, is called black and blue.</p>



<p><strong>Brochette</strong><br>The French term for kabob, food cooked on a skewer, is a brochette.</p>



<p><strong>Burn Pot</strong><br>A burn pot is where the wood pellets ignite and produce the heat and smoke.</p>



<p><strong>Drip Pan</strong><br>A drip pan is a metal or disposable foil pan that is placed under food to catch drippings when grilling. A drip pan can also be made from aluminum foil.</p>



<p><strong>Charcoal Briquettes</strong><br>Compacted ground charcoal, coal dust, and starch are used to form briquettes that are used as fuel in charcoal grills.</p>



<p><strong>Charcoal Grill</strong><br>A grill that is designed for use with charcoal, rather than gas or wood pellets.</p>



<p><strong>Fat Cap</strong><br>The fat cap is the thick layer of fat between the meat and the skin. The meat should be placed so that the fat cap is in top, allowing the fat to run down the meat.</p>



<p><strong>Fire Box</strong><br>The fire box is the bottom part of the grill that holds the fire or heat.</p>



<p><strong>Gas Grill</strong><br>A gas grill is a grill that is designed to use either propane or natural gas. These grills are easier to use than other types of grills and they heat up faster, but may not give meats the same flavor as other types of grills.</p>



<p><strong>Grill</strong><br>The place where you are cooking your barbecue, and the process of barbecuing.</p>



<p><strong>Kabobs</strong><br>Pieces of meat, poultry, seafood, and/or vegetables, threaded on a skewer and grilled are called kabobs.</p>



<p><strong>Lump Charcoal</strong><br>Carbon residue of wood that has been charred, usually in the form of lumps, is called lump charcoal. It is used as the heat source in charcoal grills.</p>



<p><strong>Marinade</strong><br>A marinade is a liquid that helps tenderize meats or adds flavor to meats. Marinades are made from a wide variety of liquids including soy sauce, wine or fruit juice, and often contain fresh or dried herbs and/or spices.</p>



<p><strong>Marinate</strong><br>To marinate is the process of using a marinade on the meat before cooking it.</p>



<p><strong>Mop</strong><br>A mop is a thin, usually vinegar based sauce (like BBQ sauce) that is basted on a piece of meat while it’s cooking.</p>



<p><strong>Rub</strong><br>Rubs are either of the wet or dry variety and are full of spices, herbs and seasonings that enhance the flavor of the food you are cooking. Rubs can either be rubbed on the meat or just sprinkled on.</p>



<p><strong>Skewer</strong><br>A skewer is a metal or wood stick that us used to hold small pieces of meat, seafood or vegetables for cooking on a grill.</p>



<p><strong>Smoke</strong><br>Meats can be smoked for a couple of reason. First, it can be done to help preserve the meat. Second, it can be done to impart a smoky flavor to the meat. If you are just smoking and not cooking, cheeses can also be smoked.</p>



<p><strong>Tenderize</strong><br>Tougher costs of meat can be tenderized to make them easier to eat. Mechanical tenderizing means using something like a hammer to break up the fibers of the meat, while certain tenderizers can do the same thing, but may take longer. Mango is one thing that will tenderize meats, but be careful not to leave the meat in too long, or it could fall apart before you even get it to the grill.</p>



<p><strong>Wood Chips</strong><br>Natural wood chips can be added to a fire to impart a smoky flavor to food as it cooks. Alder, apple, cherry, hickory, maple, mesquite, and oak are some of the more popular wood chips that can be used. Often, they are soaked in a liquid to keep them from boring too quickly. The wood chips can also be soaked in a liquid, like a brine or a simple syrup, that may impart its own flavor to the food.</p>



<p><strong>Wood Pellets</strong><br>Wood pellets are used in socially designed grills.</p>



<p>Maybe you learned something new. This may not be a complete list of the terms used in barbecuing. Perhaps you have some of your own to add to the list.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&#8220;Jesus loves me, this I know.  Just that sometimes, I have to go real slow.&#8221;</p>



<p>The trend has long been to do more, faster and better than before. I think we all feel the pressure in some way to get more done. Yet, even God took a day off.</p>



<p>There are at least a few ways to take a step back from our work. We just have to figure out what works best for us.</p>



<p>Plan ahead to do nothing. It could mean that you plan to set aside a few minutes each day, or it could mean that you plan to take a full day off each week. It also means figuring out what you may need to do or to put off in order to take this time.</p>



<p>By doing nothing, I don’t mean that you have to lie in bed and not move. What I’m talking about may look like one of the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Take a nap.</li>



<li>Call a friend.</li>



<li>Journal.</li>



<li>Pray or pick up a Bible.</li>



<li>Draw, crochet, cook or something else.</li>



<li>Take a leisurely walk.</li>
</ul>



<p>These are just a few ideas. The thing is that some of us — myself included — have to plan things or else they just don’t happen. And, for me, even putting something on a to-do list dues’t guarantee that it will get done.</p>



<p>The thing is to do something that you will enjoy doing. And keep it simple. Don’t think, as I some times do, my neighbor’s lawn needs cleaning, so I’m going to take care of that. Yes, there is a time for these things, but it cannot replace taking at least a little time to replenish ourselves.</p>



<p>Can taking time off be taken to extremes? Yes, everything can. That’s probably why God limited it to one day. And when God gave us 10 commandments, taking time off was just one of them — and not even the first.</p>



<p>We can keep ourselves so busy that we forget what we are doing it for. What we do, we should do out of love. Whether it’s working or taking time to help someone else, cooking, drawing or helping little old ladies across the street, we should do it out of love.</p>



<p>Remember, God loved us so much that He sent His one and only son to die for us so that He could restore a broken relationship between us. Yes, God had to plan ahead. He had to sacrifice something He loved. But He loved us that much.</p>

<p>Interested in learning something new? There so many tools that can help speed you along the way. Not only are there the traditional tools, but there are a number of electronic tools that can help you learn and memorize new information. Here are some you can use.</p>



<p>Apps<br>Apps for your phone can be downloaded from your favorite app store and can be easily used. While some are free, they may require some kind of registration. Others, which offer different classes, usually have some sort of cost. Remember, however, that apps like YouTube and iTunes U offer a great deal of free content.</p>



<p>Audio Books<br>One of my favorite way to learn is just to listen to audio books. Subjects include business, health and wellness, history, science and technology, just to name a few. If you have a daily commute or are able to listen to audio books at work, this can be an excellent option.</p>



<p>Chalkboard or dry eraser board<br>One way of memorizing long sentences or phrases is to write it out and read it out loud. Each time you read it, erase one or more words and see if you can remember what the missing words are.</p>



<p>Doodles<br>According to teachwell.com, “Doodling can actually help you focus and make it easier to listen. It can relieve stress and improve productivity. It can also help in memory retention; doodle a number or word or image that pertains to what’s being addressed and it’s more likely to stay with you. And there’s no such thing as a mistake; they are your doodles, and whatever you create is just right.” They do warn, however, that doodling can be a distraction to the one who is speaking or teaching.</p>



<p>Flow charts<br>Unlike traditional note taking, some people prefer to organize their notes into flow charts, bubbles of information, usually connected by lines. You can use notebooks or apps that are designed for putting together flow charts.</p>



<p>Index cards<br>I find that index cards work very well for memorizing large amounts of information. I can have a stack of 100 or more information. Easier cards can be removed from the stack in order to work on information that is harder to memorize. You can, for example, put a word on one side and it’s definition on the other. Index cards can also be shuffled and flipped.</p>



<p>Remember, the mind is the one tool that stays sharper with use. To put something into long term memory, it has to be studied or done repeatedly.</p>

<p>I used to wonder if an someone could build a group of businesses that work together to support a ministry that helps the homeless — and do so without having to ask for donations. I used to wonder if I could structure such a business. I wonder a lot of things, and like all of the others, it hasn’t happened yet.</p>



<p>There is, it seems, a county, somewhere, that is doing something similar. I’m pretty sure it’s too much for one person to do. Yet, there are business that are helping others while they (hopefully) make a profit. They aren’t asking for donations. Still, they are able to help others.</p>



<p>One such organization is COL1972, who gives part of its profits to help expectant mothers. They help save lives. You can read more about COL1972 in the <a href="https://llgt.cafe/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/April-2023-issue-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April 2023 edition</a> of LLGT Cafe.</p>



<p>Tom’s Shoes has long been dedicated to producing quality shoes. Their commitment is to donate one pair of shoos for every pair of shoes purchased. Tom’s is also investing in their local community and, according to their website, they have helped over a million individuals since 2006.</p>



<p>Tacos 4 Life has a similar strategy. For every meal that is purchased, they are able to provide one meal through another organization.</p>



<p>I heard of one restaurant that gave customers the opportunity to pay it forward by purchasing slices of pizza for others. A customer could buy a ticket and that ticket would be placed on a bulletin board for anyone who could not afford to buy their own pizza.</p>



<p>We don’t have to own a business to do good. There are countless charities that we can donate to. We can choose to support expedient mothers, we can help organizations like the Arbor Day Foundation, we can help children through <a href="https://www.compassion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Compassion International</a>, or we can hand $20 to the cashier at Starbucks to pay it forward for the next customer that comes along.</p>



<p>One thing is clear. Life can be hard. Some times we need help and we shouldn’t have to go at it alone.</p>

<p>When I was much younger, I wanted to be an inventor. Inventing seems so cool. You get to use both your mind and your imagination to create new things, or just find better or different ways of doing things that are already being done.</p>



<p>There have been so many inventors throughout the years. Some of their inventions became a part of our everyday lives, while others did not. And not all inventors have been fully recognized for the inventions that they have introduced into the world.</p>



<p>According to an obituary published in November 12, 1909 issue of “The New York Times”, The friends of Dr. THEODORE RUGGLES TIMBY, who died this week, aged 91, poor and generally neglected, are convinced that he invented the revolving gun turret used first on war vessels of the Monitor type. Many persons in public life have admitted the priority of TIMBY&#8217;S invention to ERICSSON&#8217;S.</p>



<p>Here are some inventors that you may not have heard of:</p>



<p>Choe Yun-ui invented the metal type printing press, close to two hundred years before Johannes Gutenberg invented his printing press.</p>



<p>In 1959, Ernie Fraze invented the pop top found on soda cans. Though not truly recognized for his invention, which was was inspired by a picnic, by 1980, Fraze&#8217;s company and invention were bringing in $500 million dollars of annual revenue.</p>



<p>George Heilmeier invented the liquid crystal display, which helped bring us the first digital watches and clocks, along with the first digital calculators. They were only black and white, but they were a major step towards the electronics that we have today and, on some devices, are still in use.</p>



<p>Giovanni Caselli’s pantelegraph, created in1860, was actually the first fax machine.</p>



<p>James Goodfellow created the ATM in pin number pad in 1966 so people can take money out of the bank after hours.</p>



<p>In April 1954, Gordon Teal, an inventor at Bell Labs, crated the first silicon transistors.</p>



<p>Henry Heyl invented the cinema in 1870, in spite of Thomas Edison’s claim that no one invented the cinema. Sadly, with the CORONA virus, many movie theaters are being hit hard, and some are even closing. We are, however, seeing an upsurge in drive-in theaters.</p>



<p>Robert Kearns invented windshield wipers in 1967. Perhaps his greatest source of earnings has come from lawsuits against those who have stolen his idea. These lawsuits take in an estimated $30 million each.</p>



<p>Mary Anderson also created the windshield wiper. Her introduction of the windshield wiper came in 1903. It’s doubtful, however, that she took in any money from lawsuits.</p>



<p>Margaret Knight invented a machine that automated the folding of the paper grocery bag in 1879.</p>



<p>Bette Nesmith Graham invented Liquid Paper in 1951, allowing writers and typists to fix errors made on paper.</p>



<p>George Washington Carver, Dec 13, 2019 to January 5, 1943, did not invent peanut butter as many are taught. Marcellus Gilmore Edson did. Carver claimed to have invented over 300 peanut related inventions, and there’s no reason to doubt his claims.</p>



<p>These days, I have more ideas than ever, but few of them are along the lines of inventions. Most of my ideas are ideas for writing or shot videos that I would like to make. And who knows, some day I may create a better toaster. Someone else can work on mouse traps.</p>

<p>Feeling stuck. Not sure how to get out of the daily grind? Maybe you just want to try something different but aren’t sure where to start. Here are some ideas that may help.</p>



<p>Start small. Take a moment to write down a list of things that you would like to start doing: exercising, eating more vegetables, remembering to feed your dog, for example. Find a place to put this list where you can see this list each morning and throughout the day. I have mine on a dry eras board. If you want to walk each day, start out with a two to ten minute walk. On weekends, I may walk three hours or more, but I try to walk a little each day, even if it’s to the fridge.</p>



<p>Try joining a church, a church small group for larger churches, or a club. Volunteer for a local charity or for the library. There are so many organizations that can use volunteer help.</p>



<p>Seek a new job/career or get a second job. You may have to do this if you loose your current job for whatever reason. Hopefully, this doesn’t happen, but it happens all the time. It can seem like a good thing, but often, it does’t. Either way, put your energy into finding something new and, if possible, exciting.</p>



<p>Take up a hobby. There are so many to choose from. Just within art there is photography, watercolor, pastel, color pencil, charcoal, those little fluffy things and so much more. You may even want to take a class that can help you learn a craft and may help you meet others who are also interested in art.</p>



<p>Teach a class. I found a local store, Natural Grocers, that allows me to use their kitchen to teach a class. They also provide me with up to $100 groceries to use as a demo. They do have rules that I am required to follow but nothing too difficult. I’ve only done one class but another is scheduled for next month. Just make sure that, if you decide to teach your class that you know your subject. Curiosity helps, too.</p>



<p>Find others to go for walks with. There may be a local photography club, too, as well as writers and speakers clubs. You should be able to do a Google search for local clubs.</p>



<p>The greatest/best change in my life came when I put my faith in Jesus to pay my sin debt and restore a relationship with God. John 3:16 (KJV) tells us that, <strong>“ For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</strong> It gives us what we cannot earn and what none of us deserve: forgiveness, wholeness and eternal life. Some things, we get as soon as we accept God’s gift, while other things take a lifetime to change. A prayer of salvation is just the beginning.</p>



<p>Change can be hard at times, especially if it is forced on us. But it doesn’t have to be. It’s our decision as to whether we see change as a good or bad thing. Try to see it as a good thing. In one way, change will occur, with or without us.</p>



<p>Note: I’m not talking about some changes that others may try to force upon us. Even a lie can seem true if you hear it often enough. Keep an open mind to differing views and you should be able to decide what to think about differing issues on your own. Is there a write and wrong? In some cases, yes, but in others, no. You are the one who decides which is which, at least in your own mind. And this, too, may change over time.</p>
