<p>I don’t feel much like writing, today. Now, I have a choice. I can take the day off from writing, or I can just sit down and write.</p>



<p>There are several things that we can base our decisions on: things like priorities, values and emotions. And it’s likely that we make many of our choices base on more than one of these things.</p>



<p>Commercials show us a picture of an amazing looking picture of a burger or a pizza, not because their food looks that amazing, but so that we will remember then the next time we are hungry. The commercial may even make us hungry, so that we may associate being hungry with wanting that food.</p>



<p>The things we remember — friends and co-workers, gatherings or events — we remember most for how they make us feel.</p>



<p>The problem is that emotions are often a poor source of guidance when it comes to decision making. Say, for example, I really want to buy something, but don’t have the money. I can try to find a better price, I can wait and save up for what it is that I want, or I can buy it on credit, assuming that I have the available credit.</p>



<p>Some times, we have to put off doing the things that we want to do. Other times we may need to do the things that we don’t really feel like doing. It’s called self control, and our level of self control, along with other determining factors, will help us in our decision making and help guide our actions.</p>



<p>As with everything else, I like to write things out: get it on paper so that I can better sort things out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>My friend’s granddaughter is in that stage where “why” has become her favorite word. She has been quietly learning all of her life, but is now able to ask questions. She’s not yet to the point of being able to ask more complex questions, and may be at a few years away from asking “why not”, but this is her way of learning. And though it may get old after a while, it is an important stage of her growth.</p>



<p>So, why do we stop asking “why”? Do we think that, as some point, we have learned everything that we need to know.</p>



<p>It may be that we fall into the trap of conformation bias. Any information that contradicts what we have already learned tends to be ignored or somehow lost amongst all of the other information. And it doesn’t help that social media is able to learn our habits, and is able to show us only the things that it thinks that we want to see.</p>



<p>I’ll admit that there are several things that I have no interest in learning. Either I’ve tried in the past and found it too difficult, tried and just didn’t enjoy, or was never really introduced to them.</p>



<p>It’s said that the brain is a magnificent thing, able to learn vast amounts of information from the time we are born till we fall in love. As in love, we begin to focus our attention, usually on one thing. We find one or more things that we excel at, and that is what we spend most of our time doing.</p>



<p>But could we spend more time asking “why”, if not out loud, at least in our minds. And could we ask even greater questions, like “what would happen if…?”, and “would it be possible to…?”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many of us, when we dare to ask why, are left with the answer, “because I said so,” That may be a suitable answer some of the time but, perhaps it is used to frequently. Even many college professors resent being questioned, and new college students can be belittled into just accepting everything that they are taught as truth.</p>



<p>Proverbs teaches us that “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,” and that wisdom should be taught in the home. But the schools and the entertainment industry tell us that our parents don’t know anything, and that it’s up to our schools, our friends, and television or the internet to teach us everything that we need to know.</p>



<p>I think that it’s time we start asking why, again. I don’t mean the self pity of “why me” but why are things the way the are, and how can I make thing better for myself and for others. We can ask ourselves, where have we failed, and what can we learn. There are so many questions that we ask, but it all begins with one: “Why”.</p>

<p>I think I know how the Hebrews felt: you know, the ones who had lived in Egypt and God brought them out and led them into the wilderness. God had promised to bring the Hebrews into the promise land, but they didn’t believe him and, more than once, began to complain about Moses and about what God was doing.</p>



<p>There are several things that can cloud our judgment. Fear is a bid one. Most often, the things that we fear aren’t real, but our bodies and our minds can react to things that are not real in the same way as things that are.</p>



<p>Fear can freeze us in inaction or it can cause us to run away. It can be something that we fear will happen or something that we fear won’t happen. It can even be something that has happened and we fear what might happen next.</p>



<p>Anger can cause us to do irrational things. Unfortunately, most of the time, anger is caused by a miscommunication or a misunderstanding. Anger is responsible for fights and, in the worst cases, murder.</p>



<p>One of the best ways to counter anger is with humility. We have to realize that we don’t know everything and try to get to the root of the anger, whether it is our own anger or someone else’s.</p>



<p>Sadness and loneliness can also affect our thinking. These feelings can lead to depression. The worst part is that the depressed person tends to be a loner and doesn’t often seek help.</p>



<p>Love can also cloud our vision. What I mean is the kind of love that makes us feel funny or all warm inside. This kind of love can cause us to do things that we wouldn’t otherwise do. And, believe me, I’ve been there more often than I care to admit.</p>



<p>Perhaps the best thing we can do when we have these emotions is to begin to ask ourselves questions. Are the things that we are feeling reasonable? Is it possible that our thinking is wrong? What are these emotions doing to me? If possible, find someone else to help explore these questions: someone whom you trust to help find the right answers.</p>



<p>Emotions in themselves aren’t bad. Even the Bible tells us that it is okay to be angry, but it warns us not to sin and not to let the sun go down on our anger. The thing is to learn to control our emotions, instead of letting them control us. When we can do that, the happier — or at least content — we are likely to be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As human beings, it’s easy to want a little more: a little more sleep, a few more things, a little more money and a little more of whatever you want to add to the list. We all want more of something. But, as Christians, we are meant to be different.</p>



<p>“Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.” — 1 Peter 1:16 (KJV)</p>



<p>A simple definition of holy is to be set apart: to be different. If the world is goes one way, we are supposed to go another way. The world wants entertainment that is more graphic, more realistic and more violence. The world wants clothes that are more revealing and less responsibility for our choices. But the Bible tells us that each of us is responsible for his actions and to stay away from the things of this world.</p>



<p>A little more sleep sounds good, but Proverbs 6:10-11 tells us, “Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.”</p>



<p>The world tells us to get everything that we can, now. Matthew 6:19-20 says, “Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal.”</p>



<p>As Christians, our desire should be to be closer to God and more like his Son. We should be more loving (patient, kind and long suffering). As believers in Jesus, we need to remember that each day brings us closer to our eternal home. Our hope isn’t in this world but in the world to come.</p>



<p>The world tells us that we cannot be happy without more, but God tells us to be content with what we have: to be thankful for all that God has given us. We’re not to waste what we have or deny the things that we are given. Yet, above all else, we are to love God.</p>



<p>Instead of looking for more of the things that take us away from God, Christians need to seek after things that will bring us closer to God. We should spend more time in prayer, reading the Bible and time with other Christians.</p>



<p>“Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.” — Philippians 4:8 (KJV)</p>



<p>Jesus compares his follows to salt and light. As salt, we are to make a positive difference everywhere we go. As light, we are to make a real difference in a dark world. But how can we make a positive difference if we are just like the world.</p>



<p>Remember, God loves you. If you have put your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, God will begin to work in your life. Things won’t always be easy. In fact, we are promised to have difficult times. “Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ.” — Philippians 1:6 (KJV)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Why does it seem so hard to just be content? I was asking myself this the other day, and I think that I’ve some up with a few answers. I say a few because this feeling of discontent likely has multiple causes. This is what I came up with.</p>



<p>Circumstances<br>It’s easy to let our circumstances drag us down. These are things that, to a large extent, we cannot control. They range from the weather to traffic, unexpected expenses and the death of someone that we love. We can prepare ourselves for certain things. We can have warm clothes for the winter, snow tires for the ice and snow, an emergency fund, and we can leave early to deal with traffic. But there are things that we can’t entirely prepare for and even the things that we can plan for can catch us off guard.</p>



<p>The thing is that the Bible says in many ways that we shouldn’t base our feelings on our circumstances but on faith and on God’s Word written in the Bible. Circumstances change all the time, but God’s Word never changes; His Word never fails.</p>



<p>We may face trials and tribulation, but the Bible tells us that such things make us stronger. We may loose loved ones, yet Christians have a hope of seeing other believers in Heaven. And a rebuke from God is proof that He loves us because He corrects those whom He loves.</p>



<p>Expectations<br>Expectations are another big one. You think something bad is going to happen and when it does, boy, are you ready for it. Or, if you think something good is going to happen and you wait for it, and wait for it, and it seems like it may never happen, it’s easy to start getting a little frustrated, a little blue.</p>



<p>Comparison<br>This one has long been known to cause discontent. We want something but never seem to be able to afford it. Or we get something, but it’s not as nice as someone else’s.</p>



<p>There is also this feeling that we could different: we could have more, do more or even be more. It is because we often know ourselves bette than anyone else, we see the mistakes that we have made, the places where we could have done better, and the things that we really had hoped to do with our lives but never seemed to be able to get started.</p>



<p>Knowing/Not Knowing<br>There are times when we want to know something, so we may search for an answer. But when we find that answer, we may not like what we find out. Jeremiah was known as the weeping prophet because he saw what was coming and he mourned over the sins of his people.</p>



<p>We can also know that something is coming, whether good or bad, but not know when it might come. Or, we can hear two or more sides to a story but not know for sure whose story is right.</p>



<p>Misses Blessing and a Curse<br>I was driving through Spokane the other day when I saw two people in the front seat of a car flip off someone whose driving they obviously did not appreciate: a double flip with a half gainer. I give it a 4 or a scale of 1 to 10.</p>



<p>I don’t think that we know how to bless each other, and we may not even know how to receive a blessing. A blessing could be as simple as a smile, but it could also be a kind word.</p>



<p>Often, we are better at curing others: making fun of things that we don’t understand, calling others worthless, or telling others that they cannot do something without putting in an effort to try and help her do what it is that she wants to do. This is one area where I still need work.</p>



<p>Separation<br>Even before social distancing became an every day habit, it seems that hugs had become a thing of the past. Hugs have gone from something that happened maybe once a week to something that happens maybe once a year at best. And the fear of spreading a virus has taken away even the hand shake (tough not entirely). The thing is that human contact, or the lack thereof, has a huge impact, not only our emotional health but our physical health as well.</p>



<p>“Husbands, hug your wives.” — 1 Hallmark 1:2</p>



<p>Conversations seem to be a dying skill, and laughter seems to have been put on the shelf. I still have at least one friend whom I look forward to spending time with but, most days, I hardly talk to anyone at work, there’s no one to talk to when I get home, and I sleep the rest of the day.</p>



<p>Can I fix these issues, either some or all? No, not really. but just knowing and understanding the cause of my discontent has been a big help. My hope is that it will help you, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I wish that an education could make all of our lives better. I wish it were that easy, but it’s not.<br>Growing in our knowledge base does have several benefits.</p>



<p>One benefit is that being smart, or at least feeling smart can help us feel better about ourselves. No doubt there are going to be people or tests who are more than willing to tell us what we don’t know or what we’re not good at. We don’t have to listen to them, but it is nice to feel that we are good at something.</p>



<p>Knowing how to do something may also give us an advantage in our marketplace. Simply putting our experience into a resume may help a person start out at a higher wage and, over time, that money can add up.</p>



<p>While learning about one subject may help us excel in one area, knowing more about different areas can help us converse with different people. Having an overall curiosity can do pretty much the same thing.</p>



<p>I think it’s important that we stay curious, that we never loose the urge to learn. Stop learning and you start dying. Yet it seems to me that people, younger and younger are form their opinions with a “no one’s going to change my opinion” mentality.</p>



<p>I think that continuing to learn helps keep our minds younger, too. Yes, it depends, in large part on the things that we take into out bodies and the other things that we do. Our body acts like a machine; fail to take care of it, damage it in some way and it won’t work the way that is supposed to. On the other hand, if we take care of ourselves, if we feed both our bodies and our minds properly, we’re likely to be better off in the long run.</p>



<p>I say better off, but we will not necessarily be better people. The saying that a little knowledge can be dangerous may just be true. But it depends on our character and on our decisions. Give two people $1,000 and one may turn it into a $100 thousand, while the other may loose $99 at the casino. Our character and personal drive have more power to take us places than any amount of knowledge.</p>



<p>There are also a couple of problems with knowledge. One is that knowledge without drive or direction won’t take us anywhere. It’s like having a Ford Mustang that we keep in neutral, while knowledge without character may take us down the wrong road. Knowledge is simply a tool. It can be a good thing in the right hands, or it could be misused in the wrong hands.</p>



<p>I’ve been around long enough to see that some people seem to feel that their education makes them better than others. Indeed, more education can help, but it does not make one group better than another. Our value ought to come from our creator, and we ought to use whatever we have to help others. It can be a tough lesson to learn but there is nothing that we have that we have not been given by God. It should make us more humble rather than more proud. And it should be this perspective that helps us shape our view of ourselves as well as those around us.</p>



<p>Another problem, if you want to see it this way, is that the things that we “know” is constantly changing. The things that we thought were true just a few years ago may have been revised or even proven wrong. Or there may be a better way to do something that we’ve been doing all of our lives.</p>



<p>At the same time, there is so much information that it’s impossible to keep up. I heard a story about a woman who entered her chosen career field and, because she failed to keep learning, those who entered the same career filed just a few years later were way ahead of her and she felt like there was no way to keep up.</p>



<p>Also, you may have heard the saying, “You can’t take it with you (when you die).” I have a hard time believing that we forget everything when we die. Perhaps, it’s just that there won’t be a use for many of the things that we’ve learned in this life. There won’t be cars that break down and need to be fixed, there won’t be computers that need to be programmed, and their aren’t likely to be a need for lawyers to defend us.</p>



<p>If you want to work on something, work on your character. Work at being a better person, loving others rather than judging them. Choose to look for similarities rather than differences, and ways to encourage rather than discourage. At the same time, never give up your curiosity. And never stop learning.</p>

<p>Feeling stuck. Not sure how to get out of the daily grind? Maybe you just want to try something different but aren’t sure where to start. Here are some ideas that may help.</p>



<p>Start small. Take a moment to write down a list of things that you would like to start doing: exercising, eating more vegetables, remembering to feed your dog, for example. Find a place to put this list where you can see this list each morning and throughout the day. I have mine on a dry eras board. If you want to walk each day, start out with a two to ten minute walk. On weekends, I may walk three hours or more, but I try to walk a little each day, even if it’s to the fridge.</p>



<p>Try joining a church, a church small group for larger churches, or a club. Volunteer for a local charity or for the library. There are so many organizations that can use volunteer help.</p>



<p>Seek a new job/career or get a second job. You may have to do this if you loose your current job for whatever reason. Hopefully, this doesn’t happen, but it happens all the time. It can seem like a good thing, but often, it does’t. Either way, put your energy into finding something new and, if possible, exciting.</p>



<p>Take up a hobby. There are so many to choose from. Just within art there is photography, watercolor, pastel, color pencil, charcoal, those little fluffy things and so much more. You may even want to take a class that can help you learn a craft and may help you meet others who are also interested in art.</p>



<p>Teach a class. I found a local store, Natural Grocers, that allows me to use their kitchen to teach a class. They also provide me with up to $100 groceries to use as a demo. They do have rules that I am required to follow but nothing too difficult. I’ve only done one class but another is scheduled for next month. Just make sure that, if you decide to teach your class that you know your subject. Curiosity helps, too.</p>



<p>Find others to go for walks with. There may be a local photography club, too, as well as writers and speakers clubs. You should be able to do a Google search for local clubs.</p>



<p>The greatest/best change in my life came when I put my faith in Jesus to pay my sin debt and restore a relationship with God. John 3:16 (KJV) tells us that, <strong>“ For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</strong> It gives us what we cannot earn and what none of us deserve: forgiveness, wholeness and eternal life. Some things, we get as soon as we accept God’s gift, while other things take a lifetime to change. A prayer of salvation is just the beginning.</p>



<p>Change can be hard at times, especially if it is forced on us. But it doesn’t have to be. It’s our decision as to whether we see change as a good or bad thing. Try to see it as a good thing. In one way, change will occur, with or without us.</p>



<p>Note: I’m not talking about some changes that others may try to force upon us. Even a lie can seem true if you hear it often enough. Keep an open mind to differing views and you should be able to decide what to think about differing issues on your own. Is there a write and wrong? In some cases, yes, but in others, no. You are the one who decides which is which, at least in your own mind. And this, too, may change over time.</p>

<p>When it comes to our emotions, there are a couple of rules that we ought to follow. The first is probably easier and it’s this: don’t take up another persons complaint. This isn’t to say that if someone is having a problem that you shouldn’t try to help, but if you know someone who has something agains another person, you shouldn’t take up the other person’s complaint as if it were your own.</p>



<p>I’m not talking about when someone is harassing or bullying someone that you care about. And it’s just fine to listen to someone to help him or her work through what the core problems might be and to talk about any possible solutions, but becoming angry at someone for what they did to someone else does no good.</p>



<p>The other rule is that we should not let others have total control over our emotions. A friend put it this way: others can make me happier, but they cannot take away my happiness. It’s a good way to look at those around us, and it’s a good idea for our circumstances as well. We need to have a base level of happiness that comes from within, something that won’t go away if our circumstances or someone else tries to take it away.</p>



<p>It’s no surprise that, because of the control necessary to train in kung fu that the martial arts teach a high level of control, not only of the body but also the mind. And, if you like, you can train in the martial arts, or you can become a monk in order to learn to control your emotion. You can also just decide to follow these two rules. But remember that it can take time to make these rules a part of your life.</p>



<p>Doing these things is kind of like exercising a muscle. The more we practice these skills, the better we will become at following them. For years, I was content with my surroundings — friends and family, and even my job. And thought there were times when I felt trapped, I wasn’t in any hurry to change either. Then life happened and I was forced to make changes in my life.</p>



<p>I’ll admit, it wasn’t easy, building a new life. And after two years of settling in to my new lifestyle, live happened, again. This time, however, I was kind of ready for it. I say kind of because being out of work for nearly three weeks was kind of hard, but it wasn’t unbearable. And now that I’m working at my new job, I&#8217;m okay with my circumstances.</p>



<p>One thing that I’ve seen is that we can be happy in the worst of circumstances as we can be miserable in the best of circumstances. It’s not our circumstances that make us happy or miserable but how we choose to see the details within our circumstances.</p>



<p>Maybe you’ve grown tired of seeing the same view day after day, month after month and year after year. You can choose to see the world around you through new eyes. It’s your choice. You can do it.</p>



<p>It may take a little more work to choose your own emotions but, in the end, the results are well worth the extra effort that it takes. But don’t take my word for it. Try it, you’ll like it. And if you don’t, you can ask for a full refund.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>So, here’s a question: I’m told that we carry a lot in our DNA. I’ve heard that even parts of our personality can be found in an individual’s DNA. I’ve also heard that trauma can affect an individuals DNA that can passed down generation after generation.</p>



<p>So, my first question is this: if both sides of a family suffered trauma — say WWII for example and the killing of millions of the people of at least one of them, might this DNA be passed on to following generations?</p>



<p>Here’s another question? How far might this DNA go back? Adam must have been traumatized when he was evicted — by God himself — from the only land he had ever know. How about Eve? I mean, I really hate snakes.</p>



<p>Able received a fatal head trauma and I doubt he recovered from that. Could that still affect modern medicine as we know it today? I don’t know.</p>



<p>Jacob had to leave his fairly and forfeit everything that he had worked so hard to steal from his brother. He did get his dad’s blessing, but you cannot pack that in carry on. Then, in turn, he was tricked by another family member. And his wife nearly died after she stole the family gods. Plus, he had his brother to deal with on the journey home — the one that never happened.</p>



<p>David lost at least two sons and had a man killed mob style after David slept with his wife. I know the guilt was eating him alive. And don’t forget King Saul who had to have gotten really ticked at times: enough to try to hunt down and kill young David — all because of a little envy and greed.</p>



<p>Here’s a question or two: you have no doubt seen the nude statue of young David. It’s a nude and larger than life. Did he pose for that, and would it be considered child abuse? Just kidding. The statue came long after David died and there would be no surviving pictures from that time.</p>



<p>There are others: Daniel had to face the lions. Moses killed a nan and had to leave everything that he was familiar with. Mary had to face her family with unexpected news. Many were killed, and that has to have an affect on someone’s life.</p>



<p>In high school, I had a very wise vice principal who once asked me how I managed to, not only graduate with honors but receive an invitation to intern in Washington DC. I don’t know the answer to either one. My mom wouldn’t let me take the internship.</p>



<p>We can look at these events in horror — letting the adrenal gland overpower our emotions (this takes about a minute, I hear). That’s one option. Or we can stop and, after taking a deep breath ask ourselves if what we think we are experiencing is real or not. Or we can thank God for protecting us from what might have happened. In particular, I’m thinking of a car that nearly ran me over. I was in the crosswalk and the driver made an illegal turn. But it happened so quickly, that I had no time to react. Yes, God was watching out for me and I knew it.</p>



<p>You see, as I told Sandy, hurt people hurt people. If someone hurts me — or in the case of the transfer of information through DNA — if someone hurt my mom or dad, I might suffer for it. Might I, in turn make others suffer for what my parent had experienced. It’s a valid question and is worth at least a moment of pondering.</p>



<p>I believe, though it’s not stated in the Bible, is that what that small piece of fruit might have done was to change the DNA of man and woman. I believe that Adam missed what he had so much that his loss was very traumatic. Did Adam and Eve eventually part ways after a big fight?</p>



<p>I also believe that when we are born again — and Jesus did say that we “must” be born again — that God somehow renews our DNA. The Bible does call the believer a “new creation.” What does this mean, you may ask? It means that we don’t have to follow our own inclinations to do evil. Now, we may still choose evil but, even as a believer, there will be consequences. Believe it or not, they now now that even premarital sex can lead to pregnancy. No lie.</p>



<p>So, what do we do with all of this information? If we not born again, a good place to start with is a prayer of repentance. A simple “God help me” will suffice, if it comes with faith that God actually will help. If, however, you are praying “God, help me win the $100 million dollar lottery,” you’re on you own.</p>



<p>If you are a believer, a prayer of thanksgiving will do wonders. I was helping direct traffic at church on Sunday. Soon, I was doing a signaling motion that resembled that of a music conductor and I thought to myself: “They’re playing God’s songs, these cars they are.”</p>



<p>I like to keep all questions till later — keeping them in the back of my mind until I’ve had time to sort them out. That’s how I often work best. After all, there may be a simple answer to the questions that I’ve so long pondered. I put everything out on the table — so to speak — until I’m able to mentally process it. This is an exercise that can take longer than anyone might anticipate, depending on one’s openness to the Holy Spirit. I’m working on it. I am, after all, a work in progress. I thank God that he uses a work in progress or W.I.P. like me and not a whip.</p>
