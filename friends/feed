<p>Do you want more friends? I know that there are times when I do. Here are four ideas that may help.</p>



<p>Try going somewhere new: some place you haven’t been before or, perhaps, haven’t been in a while. It may be a library, a church, a coffee shop, a store or some other place. Try going some place where you might see someone you may know but haven’t seen for a long time.</p>



<p>If there are others around, try introducing yourself. You can tell someone else your name and ask theirs. You can add a little humor, too. Recently, I introduced myself saying, “I’m not running for the office of president, so please don’t vote for me.” You can also ask questions, like “What is your favorite color,” or “If you could go anywhere in the world, where would you go?”</p>



<p>Questions are also a good way to deepen a relationship. Just don’t move ahead of the conversation into uncharted territories too quickly. Unless you know someone well enough, it may not be a good idea to ask personal questions. It may be better to ask simple questions and build other questions based on the response that you receive.</p>



<p>Finally, remember things about the person that you want to know better. It may just be his or her name for starters. If that person has a wife or husband or children, find out their names and try to remember them. I worked at a place where we all had different days off and there were several people who I could remember when their weekends was coming up; I would wish each of them a happy Friday.</p>



<p>These are just a few things that you can do to find new friends and help build relationships. Real relationships require familiarity and that takes time. Don’t be afraid to take the first step. Who knows, your next best friend could be around the corner.</p>

<p>As much as I enjoy writing, without you, it’s just me. And without your comments, I don’t know whether or not anyone is actually reading what I write.</p>



<p>In my last website, I had a lot of comments. And I had a lot of visitors. But I never knew if the visitors were actual people or just computer programs sent out to try to hack my website. And, with nearly all of the comments, there were links to porn. The rest of the links were to gambling.</p>



<p>What I want is real visits and comments by real people. That, I hope, is where you come in. I want, not to do this all by myself, but together with you. Maybe you can comment. Maybe you just let me know that you read what I wrote. Maybe you can drop me a note at LLGT Cafe, PO Box 2, Fayetteville, AR 72702. I would love to hear from you. And, if you write, I will do my best to write back.</p>



<p>You can also find me on Facebook at: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100086842894531">https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100086842894531</a></p>



<p>Now, July is National Hot Dog Month and there is still time left to celebrate. What does it take? It takes at least a hotdog and a hotdog bun, but that’s just the beginning. Here are a few things that you may want to add to your hotdog:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Pickle Relish</li>



<li>Mustard</li>



<li>Ketchup</li>



<li>Mayonnaise</li>



<li>Ranch Dressing</li>



<li>Horseradish Sauce</li>



<li>Salsa</li>



<li>Chili, for a chili dog</li>



<li>Cheese, shredded or melted</li>



<li>BBQ Sauce</li>
</ul>



<p>What ideas can you come up with? How do you cook your hot dog? Do you microwave it or grill it? I would like my hot dog with a baseball game and soda, please. Comment your ideas below and have a great National Hot Dog Month.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As an introvert, I understand what it’s like to try to make new friends. It can be really hard to meet new people. It can seem, at times, nearly impossible, especially when it seems that everyone is so busy, even if they are just checking their social media account(s). But there is hope.</p>



<p>If you can, put yourself in a social setting. Attend a conference, take a bus somewhere, go shopping or go for a walk in a place where you feel safe — like a mall.</p>



<p>It may take time, but find someone who looks familiar. Try to start a conversation. If it turns into a friendship, great, if not, maybe it will, later. Whether you are an introvert or not, friendships take time.</p>



<p>Introduce yourself and try to remember the other person’s name. Try to make the other person feel comfortable. Remember that the other person may or may not remember your name the next time — or even at the end of the conversation. Remind them of your name, or ask them to remind you of their name.</p>



<p>Humor works. I went up to someone in a store and said that I would dance with them to the music, but I wouldn’t want to embrace them. Even if you don’t immediately have a new friend with whom you can share your deepest secrets, at least you can share your smile with someone.</p>



<p>Finally, look for others who may share your interest. I attended a church where the men were more interested in talking about tractors than other subjects: not interested. Don’t look for people interested in talking about stamp collecting at a supermarket. Instead, join a stamp collecting club.</p>



<p>Yes, it can be hard to meet new people, but it’s not impossible. Try this: cover your mouth and say “impossible”. Now, take your hand and wad up the word before throwing up the word. There, you’ve just taken the word out of your vocabulary. Better yet, give it to God, for nothing is impossible for God.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The power went out some time after 7:30 AM. I found out some time around 8 AM. It seems that the rain caused a tree limb to droop down low enough to hit a power line.</p>



<p>It’s an easy fix for the power company. But if I hadn’t seen the power company truck, I would not have known.</p>



<p>What if the power weren’t back on. What would I do if the power outage were more widespread? After a tornado hit neighboring towns a little over 2 years ago, the place where I work lost power for three days.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I have backup lights, and that’s a good place to start. But that’s only a start. I can’t make my instant coffee and, if the power were still out, I wouldn’t want to open my fridge.</p>



<p>So, what is it that I need if the power goes out for an extended time — say, a week or more?</p>



<p>Light<br>Light comes in handy. And, if you have light, it helps to see what you are doing. Along with that is the batteries to power that light.</p>



<p>Water<br>Water may be next, if the water fails to run. LifeStraws are also a good source of clean water. They filter water that is not drinkable and makes it drinkable.</p>



<p>Sheler<br>Assuming that there is no structural damage, as in an earthquake or tornado, some form of protection from the heat or cold may be needed. A battery powered fan may be useful. Extra blankets can also help; sleeping bags work, too.</p>



<p>Food<br>Canned goods may be important. Try to stick with things that you know that you will use, whether in an emergency or not. If you won’t eat it before it expires, you probably shouldn’t buy it.</p>



<p>Planning<br>This includes making plans of what to do if the power goes out. You may check to see if there is still radio. If there is, great. If not, wait. Phone service may or may not work. Check the weather to see if it is raining. You may also check to see if anyone else is without power. If they have power, it’s likely that the problem is in your home or apartment. If you know your neighbors, you may be able to help them with their needs.</p>



<p>Planning can help with a lot of issues in an emergency, such as a power outage. But it can’t solve every issue that might arise. I find that prayer goes a long way, too. In an emergency, teamwork goes much further. It’s a win-win situation.</p>

<p>What would your rather have?</p>



<p>A million dollars?<br>Free food for life?</p>



<p>A trip to Hawaii?<br>A trip to the country?</p>



<p>A free pass to any more for the rest of your life?<br>The ability to read any book in seconds?</p>



<p>A new car every year for the rest of your life?<br>A car that never needed repairs?</p>



<p>A personal chef for life?<br>A personal trainer for life?<br>The man or woman of your dreams?<br>To be the man or woman of someone else’s dreams?</p>



<p>A relationship with someone whom you think the be the most beautiful or most handsome?<br>A relationship of service and commitment to the other?</p>



<p>You might think that the last one is a trick question, but true, lasting relationships, thought they may begin with physical attraction, won’t last long if that’s all there is. That’s why so many relationships don’t last. A lasting relationship needs a commitment to the other person that goes deeper and seeks to serve and love the other.</p>



<p>“Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.” — 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 (NIV)</p>



<p>There’s nothing in that verse that talks about getting our own way or having things be perfect. In fact, if we keep looking for perfection, we will never find it. But if we seek to serve, whether it be others, or the God who created us, we will become more loving. And, as 1 Corinthians tells us, there is nothing is more important that we can do than love others.</p>

<p>If you want to spend time with your friends, and are looking for an excuse to get together, these ideas just may help.</p>



<p>Find a movie that you can watch together. If you like, you can bring the TV outside and watch it in the great outdoors. Rent one of the new releases or find an old classic. Make popcorn or other snacks, and have drinks available.</p>



<p>Maybe you can find some place to go hiking. A long walk and fresh air just may be what you and your friend needs. Bring a camera and/or binoculars and, if you like, you can bring along a bird book or look for other things, like plants or mushrooms.</p>



<p>If crafting is your thing, maybe you can find something to make with your friends. You can use just about anything that you want, from wood to wax, paper to paint. Just about anything that you imagine you can make.</p>



<p>You could also cook something together. You could bake or barbecue, you could go shopping for the ingredients or catch them at a nearby lake or river. You could have an old fashion ice cream social, or tea for two.</p>



<p>Maybe you would rather go for a bicycle ride. You could go for a long or short ride. If you don’t have your own bicycle, some bicycle shops offer rentals that you can get by the hour or by the day.</p>



<p>Perhaps you would rather get together to read one of your favorite books. You can take turns reading, and talking about what you have read. This is something that you can do once, or you can get together on a weekly or monthly basis.<br>If you are musically inclined, maybe you can get together to form a band. This doesn’t mean that you have to record an album or go on tour, but you might be able to preform before a small crowd.</p>



<p>If you have some ideas of your own, please share them. We would be glad to hear our ideas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>My friend’s granddaughter is in that stage where “why” has become her favorite word. She has been quietly learning all of her life, but is now able to ask questions. She’s not yet to the point of being able to ask more complex questions, and may be at a few years away from asking “why not”, but this is her way of learning. And though it may get old after a while, it is an important stage of her growth.</p>



<p>So, why do we stop asking “why”? Do we think that, as some point, we have learned everything that we need to know.</p>



<p>It may be that we fall into the trap of conformation bias. Any information that contradicts what we have already learned tends to be ignored or somehow lost amongst all of the other information. And it doesn’t help that social media is able to learn our habits, and is able to show us only the things that it thinks that we want to see.</p>



<p>I’ll admit that there are several things that I have no interest in learning. Either I’ve tried in the past and found it too difficult, tried and just didn’t enjoy, or was never really introduced to them.</p>



<p>It’s said that the brain is a magnificent thing, able to learn vast amounts of information from the time we are born till we fall in love. As in love, we begin to focus our attention, usually on one thing. We find one or more things that we excel at, and that is what we spend most of our time doing.</p>



<p>But could we spend more time asking “why”, if not out loud, at least in our minds. And could we ask even greater questions, like “what would happen if…?”, and “would it be possible to…?”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, many of us, when we dare to ask why, are left with the answer, “because I said so,” That may be a suitable answer some of the time but, perhaps it is used to frequently. Even many college professors resent being questioned, and new college students can be belittled into just accepting everything that they are taught as truth.</p>



<p>Proverbs teaches us that “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,” and that wisdom should be taught in the home. But the schools and the entertainment industry tell us that our parents don’t know anything, and that it’s up to our schools, our friends, and television or the internet to teach us everything that we need to know.</p>



<p>I think that it’s time we start asking why, again. I don’t mean the self pity of “why me” but why are things the way the are, and how can I make thing better for myself and for others. We can ask ourselves, where have we failed, and what can we learn. There are so many questions that we ask, but it all begins with one: “Why”.</p>

<p>What is the best gift that you can give your friends or family? It’s not something that you can buy, and it’s not something that you can wrap up in a box. The best gift that you can give to anyone is your time.</p>



<p>But there is more to it than just being present. You should also be fully engaged with the other person. You shouldn’t be updating your Instagram account, or playing video games (unless you are both playing), and you shouldn’t be hiding behind a newspaper.</p>



<p>Being present means actually listening to the other person, and even responding to that person when it is appropriate: not interrupting, but acknowledging that you are listening to what the other person is trying to say.</p>



<p>It may mean scheduling time, or making adjustments to your life so that you have time to spend with friends or family. Free time may be scarce, and when it does come along, spending time with others may not be the first thing that comes to mind. Instead, we may find it easier to just spend that time alone.</p>



<p>Finally, we should try to keep ourselves healthy. We may have limited control over how long we will live, but we can at least try to stay healthy. Exercise, proper diet, along with regular physical exams can go a long way in keeping us alive longer.</p>



<p>Keep in mind that we still need to respect the time of others. Time is something that we often take for granted, but it truly is the best gift that you can give to anyone. Also, remember that time is the best gift that someone else can give to you.</p>

<p>We call it social media, but does it really help our social life? I saw a post on Facebook that said that our phones were keeping us closer to those who are far away but far from those who are close.</p>



<p>Social media isn’t really to blame for keeping those who are physically close at bay and more than the candy at the store makes me buy it. Social media is, however, designed to be easy to use, as is the candy at the store placed in a way that it is easily found.</p>



<p>Yes, social media can be a way in which we can keep in touch with family and friends who are far away. And as much as we move from place to place, it can be good to stay in touch with those we care about.</p>



<p>One problem with social media is that it allows us to put on sort of a mask that can hide reality. We don’t need social media to do this, but it can make it easier. The truth is that our lives aren’t always exciting — I know that mine isn’t — and our lives don’t always turn out the way that we might have wanted. And it can be easy to paint a false image of how well things are going — on social media or otherwise.</p>



<p>Social media tends to be one dimensional, as well, and lacks the true depth of real life. Sure, real life can be can be complicated, but that doesn’t make it bad. And easy isn’t always the best way.</p>



<p>The best way is to be open and real in our relationships. It might be hard, but it may be worth it. Ideally, one place that we ought to be the most welcome is the church. Unfortunately, all too often, this can sometimes can sometimes be one the hardest places to be open about our struggles.</p>



<p>There is a bright side to social media. With many unable to go to church, many churches have taken to the internet and are at least in part meeting online. It may not be the same as meeting in person, but the truth of God’s word may be reaching more people.</p>



<p>It may be a good idea to take a holiday from our electronics now and then. It’s hard to find group of people together where they aren’t all looking at their phones. I think that our phones and other devices have caused us to forget what it really means to be social.</p>



<p>Don’t be afraid to say hi to others. If you have time, you might even be able to ask someone else how she is doing. The problem is, though, that we are all too busy, and much of this business is due to the time we spend on social media</p>
