										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’m not exactly sure how old I was when I took my first photograph. I know that my dad had a camera and took pictures of the family as well as for work. I also know that some time around 1980, my mom took a photograph class at the university and that’s about the time I became interested in taking pictures.</p>



<p>A lot has changed over the years in the area of photography. For example, it seems that just about everyone has access to a camera these days. They’re on phones and security devices, drones and computers. When I started taking pictures, it wasn’t that way. There were no digital cameras and, if there were, they weren’t available to the general public. There were fewer photographers, especially in photography’s early years and even fewer who stood out for the work they did. Now, it seems that we’re all photographers and, it would seem, that it is even harder to stand out among other photographers.</p>



<p>Photography has always been fairly expensive. Companies like Eastman Kodak made it easier for families to own cameras in 1888 with the introduction of the Kodak. The Brownie was another film camera. Now, there are actually more camera companies, and a lot more cameras and camera types to choose from. And, though there isn’t the price of film and developing to keep in mind, but there is the price of the price of the camera, itself, memory cards, batteries and anything else that you care to add. Oh, and the first digital cameras — the first DSLRs — they had a price tag of about $5,000.</p>



<p>The quality of cameras and the photographs that they take has changed over the years. The first cameras were actually boxes with just a hole for a lens. An artist had to draw or paint the image. Film was later introduced and now we have film and digital. And the quality of both has greatly increased over time. That DSLR that cost $5,000 would have hardly produced a picture any larger than a post card. And it wasn’t until around the year 2000 that digital cameras even came close to producing the quality of images that a film camera could do. Now, we can do things with digital cameras that one could hardly imagine doing with film.</p>



<p>When I started taking pictures, I also learned how to develop black and white film and prints. I had access to a darkroom and supplies and I could spend hours working on just a few images. It was by no means, instant and color film could take a week or more to get back for a photo lab. With film, with the exception of instant cameras, there was no way to check the quality of your pictures until you developed the film or had someone else develop it. Now, we just have to look at the back of our camera or on our smart phone. We can even have a camera set up remotely and check the images on a smart device.</p>



<p>Laws have changed somewhat over the years. It’s still legal to photograph others in public. But it’s harder, in some cases to use these pictures. Rules of courtesy haven’t changed. Rules of composition and what makes a “good” photograph still hasn’t changed. And everyone is a great photographer until he or she begins comparing their work to the work of other, more experienced, photographers.</p>



<p>There are more ways to make money as a photographer, now, but there is also more competition. A single photographer can produce hundreds of thousands of images and sell them online, yet there there is still a need to fill photography gaps. Anyone can photograph a wedding, but only one photographer may have the style that suits a particular customer’s needs. It takes time and effort to get into photography as a career these days. It takes time to develop one’s style and to make significant improvement in image quality. Then it takes time for others to get to know and appreciate your work. And, if you want to make big bucks, you have to find clients with the needs and the resources to pay that money.</p>



<p>I still own a film camera — a Minox —but I don’t really use it. The last pictures I took were black and white and, without access to a dark room, these pictures took at least 2 weeks to get back. Also, when I got the pictures back, they were badly underexposed. I don’t know, but it was a fairly recent purchase and I think there is a problem with the light meter. I have a really nice camera, now. It’s the nicest camera I’ve ever had. But, these days, I get most of my pictures with my phone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Whether you have a job, a business of your own, or just a hobby that helps you pass your time, it’s good to have both a mission and a passion. Mission is simply your reason for doing what you do, while passion is what helps get you out of bed even before you’ve had your coffee or need to go to the bathroom.</p>



<p>You can mission without passion, but it is not likely that you will have passion without a mission. The best case scenario is that you would have a mission, that you have a great deal of passion and that the two are on the same path. The worst case would be that you have neither mission or passion.</p>



<p>The fact is that passion can come and go, as it tends to be built on our feelings. Mission, whatever it is, does not change. My mission is to do whatever I do as unto the Lord, and to bring him glory. It’s not about making myself or anyone else happy. If God puts me somewhere, it’s either because that is where he wants to use me, or because he wants to show me that I need to work on building a different path.</p>



<p>What is your mission, and what gets you going? Maybe it’s a hobby. Maybe you write short stories, or create beautiful songs. Maybe you serve others. Maybe you are still looking for an answer to these questions. There’s certainly noting wrong with that.</p>



<p>One thing that you can do at any age is to write down your goals. Your goals can change over time, but that’s okay. You may find it helpful, as I have, to start off by writing the things that you do not want, and then writing the opposite of that. “I do not want to be poor” becomes “I want to be rich”, and “I don’t want to work for a large corporation might become either “I want to work for a small business” or “I want to start my own business.” Make certain to be specific, and you are more likely to be able to measure your goal if it is both quantifiable and time sensitive.</p>



<p>Once you know what you want to do and you have well defined goals, break down into goals steps that can either be done once and marked off of the to-do list, or can be turned into daily tasks or even into habits. Take care of as many of the things that you can that just need to be done once, but also begin to figure out how you can turn routine items into habits. There may be just one item that you will be doing daily, and it may be something that you enjoy. For other things, it may be a little harder, and you may have to set up a mental cue.</p>



<p>It may take time, but you can set up habits that will take you, not where someone else wants to go, but where you want to go. If you do something because it is something that you want to do, rather than because you have to do it, it is likely that you are going to be more passionate about what you are doing, and it will be less of a struggle to get out of bed. Believe it or not, it’s possible to look forward to waking up at 4 in the morning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’ve decided to try to start a photography business — again. My first attempts never really got off the ground. I’m hoping that past fails have taught me something.</p>



<p>I just got back from a bridal show and picked up business cares from a few of the area of wedding photographers. Speaking of wedding photography, and photography in general, there has long been the question as to whether one style of photography is more of a form of art than another.</p>



<p>Unlike other forms of art, photography has the ability to capture things as they are, or at least as they appear to be. Video does much the same thing. Some forms of sketching can come close with the use of projectors and other tools.</p>



<p>My style of photography is more of a journalistic style of photography. I like to capture more natural settings and more natural poses. Other photographers like to control their subject, often telling the people in their photographs where to stand or sit and how to act. Some like to control every aspect of their photographs, hiring makeup artists and, perhaps, setting up special backgrounds. Other photographers choose to do all of their work post process, doing various degrees of work in software like Photoshop.</p>



<p>If you are a photographer, you may want to take a moment to consider your style. I’ve known a lot of photographers over the years and have heard of several different photographic styles. In sports photography, for example, some photographs chase the action with their camera, while others focus on one area and take pictures only when the action is in that area, such as the finish line of a race or around the basketball goal. Some photographers work more on composition, while others may look more at the story that their photographs tell.</p>



<p>My feeling is that all these styles of photography are forms of art because beauty is in the eye of the beholder or, in the case of music, the ear of the beholder. You may not like the same style of art that I like and visa versa, but that doesn’t make either preference less valid. It might even be a good idea to check out styles outside of your own preference from time to time.</p>



<p>If you can, take some time to look at some photographs, either your own or someone else’s and ask yourself what it is that you like or dislike about these pictures. What do you think when into making these pictures, and what might you do differently. Keep in mind, however, that if you are looking at someone else’s work, that your opinions probably say more about you than the artist who created the work.</p>

<p>If photography were my hero, camera equipment would be my nemesis. I can spend hours just checking out websites like B&amp;H Photo, trying to figure out what I might buy if I had the money, or watching YouTube videos on the latest gear.</p>



<p>Taking pictures is something that I enjoy doing, and it is something that I have enjoyed doing for more than forty years. There are other things that I enjoy doing, like writing and cooking, traveling and meeting new people. But if there were any of these that I could do for a living, and I have worked in the food industry for somewhere around 30 years, I would like to take pictures.</p>



<p>For me, photography isn’t about making that perfect picture, but looking at the world around me and finding the beauty, even if it’s something that lasts for just a moment, like a cloud, a hummingbird drinking nectar from a flower, or the smile on the face of a bride to be.</p>



<p>Likewise, when I cook, I like to look around and see what I have available to make for myself or for others. For me, it is a challenge to make the best meal that I can out of what I have or to come up with a meal plan based on all of the options available at the grocery.</p>



<p>Writing is something that I have done most of my life, but blogging is something that I have only recently started. When I was in college, I took a few journalism classes, hoping to combine writing with my photography. Mostly, when I write, it’s in one of my journals and, for me, writing can be relaxing and therapeutic.</p>



<p>Travel and meeting new people can be a lot of fun. Though I have had a few opportunities to travel with a group or with a guide, I have done most of my travels on my own. Some times it’s just for a day or a few hours. Other times, it’s for months or years.</p>



<p>For now, all of these things are just hobbies. Hobbies are things that we can do that we can enjoy. They can help pass time and may even make us feel better. On the other hand, we can spend our time feeding our addictions, which may cost us in more than one way or another, and often make us feel worse.</p>



<p>Then there are the things that we know, but may not fully appreciate, that foods containing high levels of fat and high levels of sugar, or items that easily convert to sugar may not be good for us, not only affecting our weight, but possible affecting our cognitive health.</p>



<p>Though I don’t have any recommendations for changing the food industry, I can recommend that, if all possible, you try to avoid processed foods and make your own. If you don’t have time to cook every day, try to pick one day where you can make a large batch and portion it out for the week, refrigerating or freezing your food if necessary. The few hours that you spend in the kitchen one day a week may be worth it in the long run.</p>
