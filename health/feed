<p>It can be difficult to know what foods and supplements are okay and which are not as good for you. Most of the things that someone can find in a health food store haven’t been clinically tested because of the cost and, all too often, the things that have been tested come back later, showing to cause cancer in lab rats.</p>



<p>I go into the health food store from time to time and see all of the health supplements on the shelves but have no idea what many of them do. Most of them aren’t cheap, either, so there’s no chance of trying these things for the fun of it, especially when any improvement may not be immediately evident.</p>



<p>Even if you can find something that works immediately, it’s hard to get others to try it. People are reluctant to try new things, especially when they don’t know much about it and haven’t done the research on their own.</p>



<p>Diets are much the same. A diet may work well, but someone may have heard something bad about that diet, so they don’t w want to try it. And like supplements, diets aren’t clinically tested because there is no one to pay the hundreds of thousands of dollars needed to conduct the trials.</p>



<p>Another problem is that the things that are “good for you” are often more expensive. I tried the keto diet for about nine months and I lost about 35 pounds. Yet, it was costing me around $300 per month in food and supplements. And when circumstances changed, I wasn’t able to follow the diet any more.</p>



<p>It used to be that snake oil salesmen went from town to town trying to make money off of unsuspecting individuals. These salesmen would make claims about a product that they were selling that were just plain fraud. These days, a company can’t label his product as healthy due to regulations, but another can label label its product as all natural because part of the product is natural.</p>



<p>My advise: do your own research. You can try to educate others, but don’t be surprised if they aren’t interested. In the end, it’s best to not spend too much time worrying about it because worry and stress isn’t good for the body, either. Find someone you trust or check out different sources, then you decide what’s best.</p>

<p>Feeling stuck. Not sure how to get out of the daily grind? Maybe you just want to try something different but aren’t sure where to start. Here are some ideas that may help.</p>



<p>Start small. Take a moment to write down a list of things that you would like to start doing: exercising, eating more vegetables, remembering to feed your dog, for example. Find a place to put this list where you can see this list each morning and throughout the day. I have mine on a dry eras board. If you want to walk each day, start out with a two to ten minute walk. On weekends, I may walk three hours or more, but I try to walk a little each day, even if it’s to the fridge.</p>



<p>Try joining a church, a church small group for larger churches, or a club. Volunteer for a local charity or for the library. There are so many organizations that can use volunteer help.</p>



<p>Seek a new job/career or get a second job. You may have to do this if you loose your current job for whatever reason. Hopefully, this doesn’t happen, but it happens all the time. It can seem like a good thing, but often, it does’t. Either way, put your energy into finding something new and, if possible, exciting.</p>



<p>Take up a hobby. There are so many to choose from. Just within art there is photography, watercolor, pastel, color pencil, charcoal, those little fluffy things and so much more. You may even want to take a class that can help you learn a craft and may help you meet others who are also interested in art.</p>



<p>Teach a class. I found a local store, Natural Grocers, that allows me to use their kitchen to teach a class. They also provide me with up to $100 groceries to use as a demo. They do have rules that I am required to follow but nothing too difficult. I’ve only done one class but another is scheduled for next month. Just make sure that, if you decide to teach your class that you know your subject. Curiosity helps, too.</p>



<p>Find others to go for walks with. There may be a local photography club, too, as well as writers and speakers clubs. You should be able to do a Google search for local clubs.</p>



<p>The greatest/best change in my life came when I put my faith in Jesus to pay my sin debt and restore a relationship with God. John 3:16 (KJV) tells us that, <strong>“ For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</strong> It gives us what we cannot earn and what none of us deserve: forgiveness, wholeness and eternal life. Some things, we get as soon as we accept God’s gift, while other things take a lifetime to change. A prayer of salvation is just the beginning.</p>



<p>Change can be hard at times, especially if it is forced on us. But it doesn’t have to be. It’s our decision as to whether we see change as a good or bad thing. Try to see it as a good thing. In one way, change will occur, with or without us.</p>



<p>Note: I’m not talking about some changes that others may try to force upon us. Even a lie can seem true if you hear it often enough. Keep an open mind to differing views and you should be able to decide what to think about differing issues on your own. Is there a write and wrong? In some cases, yes, but in others, no. You are the one who decides which is which, at least in your own mind. And this, too, may change over time.</p>

<p>Last night, I gave all of my worries to Jesus. It felt really good. It’s not the first time that I’ve trusted God with my fears, but I don’t do it nearly often enough. The first time was after a major military exam. I had just taken it that day, and the failure rate was high. I was worried, but I decided to give my worry to Jesus.</p>



<p>Maybe you have some worries of your own. I’ve learned to avoid watching television. There is a TV at work and, other than the weather, it’s mostly filled with death and misery and other things that I just don’t want to dwell on.</p>



<p>Now, it wouldn’t do any good to give Jesus my fears if I hadn’t first trusted him to take away my sins. The Bible tells us that we have all sinned. Romans 3: 23 KJV) tells us that “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” I could try to convince myself that I’m not really that bad a person, but that wouldn’t take away the fact that, by God’s standards, we are all sinners. Yet, God, who created us, the God who will one day judge his creation, made a way.</p>



<p>Acts 16:31 (KJV) tells us, “And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.” If we put our faith in Jesus who, tough he was equal with God, put on flesh to pay for our sins, then we will have eternal life. “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” — Romans 10:9 (KJV)</p>



<p>It’s easy to forget, however, that the Bible also tells us, “casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.” — 1 Peter 5:7 (KJV).</p>



<p>It is, perhaps, these cares that we carry are behind many of the problems that we face today: poor health, both mentally and physically, as well as a number of addictive behaviors. We may want to stop doing something, but it helps us forget our problems, so we keep doing it. What if, instead, we gave our problems to Jesus?</p>



<p>It’s too early to know the long term results. I may have to keep giving my cares to Jesus, but I can do that. You can, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Physical goals often top one’s list of New Year’s resolutions. And when it comes to our health and the goals that we set, there are a number of options to choose from.</p>



<p>Now, I’m not going to say that we are going to start exercising because it is something that we will enjoy doing, though there are those who truly enjoy a morning run. Personally, I prefer a more leisurely walk, with plenty of time to stop and take pictures along the way. But running and walking are not the only options to choose from.</p>



<p>First, we can choose from a goal based on a certain physical activity, a change in our diet, or one targeted at a possible result of either. For example, we could set a goal ride a bicycle at least 10 miles a week. We could decide we are going to walk or swim at least three times a week. We could decide that we will lift weights five days a week. We could also decide that we want to loose 10 pounds in the next year.</p>



<p>In setting our goals, we may need to meet with a health professional, or find a weight trainer, depending on our own unique needs. We may join a gym, or find a group of people whom we can meet with, who will join us in whatever we choose to do, and encourage us along the way. It may take some planning to get us to where we can do the thing that we set to do. In other words, we may not be able to decide that on the first day of the year, we are going to throw on our running shoes and start running and that, in doing so, we will still be running on a regular basis at the end of the year.</p>



<p>Physical goals should still meet the SMART goal setting method, meaning they should be<br>specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timed. Yet, it is likely that we will also need outside help with this goal — either a professional of some sort, or just one or more people who can encourage us along the way — helping us to keep going when we want to quit.</p>



<p>We will also need a strong enough “Why” when it comes to any goal of this sort, whether it be to exercise more, loose weight, or try a new diet. Because changes in these areas often don’t come easily, and we naturally resist such changes, we need to know why we are attempting to make these changes. It should be a reason that we believe strongly in, and it should be for us, and not for someone else.</p>



<p>One final consideration is that, if we are setting our goal based on a result that we hope to see, it could take time to reach that goal. Therefore, it may help to break larger goals into smaller goal. For example, instead of setting a goal to loose 10 pound over the next year, we may decide that we will aim at loosing one pound a month.</p>



<p>And whichever goal we set, it’s a good idea to find some way to reward ourselves along the way, as long as it doesn’t go against our goal. Occasionally rewards can help encourage us, and help keep us going month after month.</p>

<p>There are things that I wish that they would teach us in school, or at least maybe do a better job at teaching. I’m not sure it would have done any good, but the lack of education in these areas could very well have negative side affects which could be difficult to overcome.</p>



<p><strong>Finances</strong><br>I wish that schools spent a little more time teaching people how to deal with money. They certainly teach us how to figure the circumference of a triangle (that’s a joke) and how to keep score at the Friday night football game, but don’t rally teach students how to properly handle money.</p>



<p>My grandfather was good at handling money, and so is my father. Me, I didn’t get any of that passed down. And I didn’t learn anything in the public schools about handling money, how to get it, how to grow it or how to hang on to it. The worst part is that I’ve since had people show me how to handle money and, for me, it’s one of those areas where it’s much easier said than done.</p>



<p><strong>Health</strong><br>Now, I did spend some time on the swim team when I was in high school, and I was average at best. I expect that it helped over the long run, but I haven’t swam like that in years. In fact, the last time I swam in a competition was nearly 30 years ago. I remember being as high as a kite on endorphins. It’s kind of funny, now that I think about it.</p>



<p>Most of us don’t get enough information on physical fitness, or on the benefits of a healthy diet. We are fed, however, a constant diet of commercials about fast food and kept on a treadmill that limits that amount of time that we have to enjoy a proper meal. And real exercise is almost out of the question unless we force ourselves to make that choice.</p>



<p><strong>Communication</strong><br>It seems like a simple skill, but fewer things can casue more problems in life than a failure to properly communicate: to both understand and be understood. A lack of communication skills likely cost US businesses millions, if not billions of dollars, and is likely responsible for much of the divorce that occurs in the Untied States.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it seems that this skill isn’t getting any more prolific but is on the decline. Rather than being kind to one another, it’s more common to be angry or resentful, or down right nasty to one another. Common courteously just isn’t as common as it used to be.</p>



<p>There is good news. It we can still learn how to be better with finances. We can improve our health. And we can learn better ways of communication. It’s not to late to start making changes in our lives that can make our lives better in all sorts of ways. Yet, I cannot expect you to make the necessary changes in my life. I can’t just sit around, blaming others for my own shortcomings. It’s up to me to take the initiative. I have to take the first steps to start my own journey.</p>
