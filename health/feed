<p>If humor is good medicine, don’t forget to take yours. Here are some jokes you might enjoy. Remember, be kind. I’m going to try to make these up on my own.</p>



<p>Judy: “You can’t sit here, this seat is saved.”<br>Frank: “Good, I’ve been praying for it.”</p>



<p>Judy: “Can you help me change this lightbulb?”<br>Frank: “Lord, we ask that You would help this bulb change.”</p>



<p>Judy: “Do you think God has a sense of humor?”<br>Frank: “He made me, didn’t he?”</p>



<p>Judy: “Have you seen the weather forecast?”<br>Frank: “It’s going to be rainy HOT.”<br>Judy: “Rainy HOT?”<br>Frank: “Yes, it’s going to be raining here or there.”</p>



<p>Frank: “Did you hear about the dog that walked twelve miles to visit his Pa and Grandpa?”<br>Judy: “No, tell me more.”<br>Frank: “When he got there, his Pas were tired.”</p>



<p>Judy: “How did your trip to Germany go?”<br>Frank: “It went well. But one day, I was out and I heard music playing; it seemed to be playing backwards.”<br>Judy: “Backwards?”<br>Frank: “Yes, so I followed it.”<br>Judy: “Where did it lead?”<br>Frank: “It led me to a cemetery, where I found the ghost of Beethoven.”<br>Judy: “What did he say.”<br>Frank: “Don’t bother me, I’m decomposing.”</p>



<p>Frank: “Knock-knock.”<br>Judy: “Who’s there?”<br>Frank: “Bacon.”<br>Judy: “Bacon, who?”<br>Frank: “Seriously, Judy, bacon is no joke.”</p>



<p>I hope at least one of these made you smile. If you have your own jokes — remember to keep them clean — please comment below and have a great weekend.</p>

<p>Share a Hug Day</p>



<p>It’s tragic. A man returning home from vacation was hit by a truck that failed to stop and his wife and one of his two sons were killed in the accident. Yet, even out of tragedy, we can find reason to celebrate life.</p>



<p>Share a Hug Day, it seems, was born out of that tragedy. Though it cannot be assumed that everyone feels comfortable receiving a hug, it should be okay to ask. If the other person is okay being hugged, hug away.</p>



<p>By the way, hugs are good medicine.</p>

<p>The power went out some time after 7:30 AM. I found out some time around 8 AM. It seems that the rain caused a tree limb to droop down low enough to hit a power line.</p>



<p>It’s an easy fix for the power company. But if I hadn’t seen the power company truck, I would not have known.</p>



<p>What if the power weren’t back on. What would I do if the power outage were more widespread? After a tornado hit neighboring towns a little over 2 years ago, the place where I work lost power for three days.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I have backup lights, and that’s a good place to start. But that’s only a start. I can’t make my instant coffee and, if the power were still out, I wouldn’t want to open my fridge.</p>



<p>So, what is it that I need if the power goes out for an extended time — say, a week or more?</p>



<p>Light<br>Light comes in handy. And, if you have light, it helps to see what you are doing. Along with that is the batteries to power that light.</p>



<p>Water<br>Water may be next, if the water fails to run. LifeStraws are also a good source of clean water. They filter water that is not drinkable and makes it drinkable.</p>



<p>Sheler<br>Assuming that there is no structural damage, as in an earthquake or tornado, some form of protection from the heat or cold may be needed. A battery powered fan may be useful. Extra blankets can also help; sleeping bags work, too.</p>



<p>Food<br>Canned goods may be important. Try to stick with things that you know that you will use, whether in an emergency or not. If you won’t eat it before it expires, you probably shouldn’t buy it.</p>



<p>Planning<br>This includes making plans of what to do if the power goes out. You may check to see if there is still radio. If there is, great. If not, wait. Phone service may or may not work. Check the weather to see if it is raining. You may also check to see if anyone else is without power. If they have power, it’s likely that the problem is in your home or apartment. If you know your neighbors, you may be able to help them with their needs.</p>



<p>Planning can help with a lot of issues in an emergency, such as a power outage. But it can’t solve every issue that might arise. I find that prayer goes a long way, too. In an emergency, teamwork goes much further. It’s a win-win situation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today is National Personal Chef Day</p>



<p>This is exciting. Whether you currently have a personal chef or you can barely afford your next meal, this day is for you.</p>



<p>No, really. Having a personal chef may be a great idea and, if you are thinking about hiring one, the prices may be better than you thought. If another PBJ sandwich seems on the horizon, this information could help.</p>



<p>If you want the services of a personal chef, these tips could help.</p>



<p>Figure out a budget. Is your food budget $10, $100, or $1,000? It’s important to know. And, if need be, you can use cash.</p>



<p>Collecting coupons may help reduce the cost of groceries. I find basic ingredients — eggs, flour, milk and such — work best. Add a few ingredients, and there are so many things that you can make.</p>



<p>Plan your meals, based on simple recipes. The simpler the foods, the more likely you are to stick to the plan. Some things, like a dry pancake mix, can be made up ahead of time. A planner may come in handy, where you can plan a shopping day as well as menu options.</p>



<p>Note: it’s better to have extra options instead of having too few and having to go back to the store to buy one or two items (snacks).</p>



<p>Here are some options:<br>Oatmeal<br>Ground beef<br>Burger Buns<br>Carrots (cooked or uncooked)<br>Noodles<br>Soups<br>Mixed Greens</p>



<p>These are just a few things that you can buy. The thing to remember is to buy according to the menu plan and to the budget. Keep in mind that food often costs more than we expect. It may be better to overestimate the cost of food.</p>



<p>One helpful purchase might be containers. You can portion out food and place it in storage: the pantry, fridge or freezer. If you like, you can either label these containers with “Use By” dates, the name of the item, or the date and meal that you intend to use it. Some things freeze well, while others don’t. Some things, like mixed greens, may need to be made into a salad at the last minute.</p>



<p>So many recipes are available online. If you are in the mood for chicken, see if you can buy chicken in bulk, even if you have to portion it out and freeze it. Just don’t do as I did once and leave it out overnight. Oops.</p>



<p>Keep a running list of groceries and, remember, you don’t have to buy everything on the list: just what you absolutely need and can afford. Soup may mean canned, or fresh ingredients for the same.</p>



<p>These tips from a person chef wanna-be are free and could save you a lot of money. Of course, you can also go out to eat. Restaurants these days are struggling. Just don’t make it your job to keep them in business.</p>



<p>Let me know your ideas. Thanks, in advance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’m going to take time off today from writing. Each of us needs to take the day off now and then — to rejuvenate and refresh our minds and bodies. If we don’t — if we go to long without taking time off — we can burn out and our bodies or minds may force us to take time off because of sickness or depression.</p>



<p>Now, you may say, “I can’t take time off. There’s just too much to do.” But maybe you can take ten minutes here or there to relax, be thankful, or just enjoy life. Maybe you can take the time to take deep breaths — ten seconds breathing in, holding your breath and breathing out slowly. This can do so much to relieve stress.</p>



<p>Put on some relaxing music, go for a walk or draw. All of these things can help with stress and help refresh the mind. You don’t have to take the whole day for one activity. Just spending a little time can help.</p>



<p>If you can, find someone else to do some of the things that need to be done, even if you have to pay them, assuming you have the money and someone that you can trust.</p>



<p>Time off is just as important as the time we spent working and it cannot be ignored or put off indefinitely. It we try, it will eventually catch up with us. So, remember, now and then to take a little time off.</p>

<p>If you want to loose weight, changing your environment might help. You may not be able to remove that pizza parlor from your neighborhood, or find a way to avoid passing by the donut shop on the way to work, but there are some things that you can do at home to make loosing weight easier.</p>



<p>First, get rid of the high calorie snack foods, like cookies, sodas and even chips. I don’t mean that you should go on a binge. If you can’t give them away, maybe it would be a good idea to throw them out.</p>



<p>Next, you look for ready to eat foods that you can eat. You may find vegetable trays in your deli or produce department, or prepared fruit salads. Try to avoid the pre-made dressings. Things like plain yogurt might be a good option.</p>



<p>Plan ahead. If you have something in the fridge or on the countertop ready to go, you are less likely to look for less healthy options. Also, if you take something when you travel, you are less likely to stop for fast food.</p>



<p>Finally, try loading your refrigerator with healthier snacks. It may take some work to slice up some carrots, cut up some apples, or cook some brown rice. You can also search the internet for more ideas. You just may find that the extra effort is well worth it.</p>

<p>How much is enough? It’s a simple question, right? Last night, I got about four hours sleep. I got to bed late and woke up early. For a few, this might be enough sleep. For me, it’s not. Fortunately, I did get a little more sleep after going to an appointment that I had, but it still doesn’t seem like enough.</p>



<p>But there are less needed things that make it harder to know when enough is enough. For example, I got another lens for my camera last week. It wasn’t all that expensive compared to most of the lenses that Canon sells and it fills a “need” that my other lenses don’t. But it’s not a need, it’s a want.</p>



<p>Similarly, there is a mixer on display at Sam’s Club that looks so nice. But it’s not a need or a want, at least not now. And I don’t have room for it in my kitchen. Really the list of things could go on.</p>



<p>Conversely, there are things that I have in my life from time to time that I would rather not have: frustration, irritation and loneliness, just to name a few. These are just some of the things that I would rather not deal with.</p>



<p>Did you know that, according to the Bible, it’s the latter things — the loneliness and frustrations — that draw us closer to or make us more like God? I know it, but it’s easy to forget, especially when we’re “suffering” these things.</p>



<p>So, what are we to do? For the first, it’s best to have a budget. It needs to be one that we can stick with, and it should be as close to our actual needs as possible. I say this because things like groceries can be hard to predict, unless we really work hard at planning both the budget and our diet.</p>



<p>For the other things, we can learn to deal with them. Breathing exercises — taking a long breath in through the nose, holding it for a few seconds and a long breath out the mouth can help. Just counting slowly to ten can also help.</p>



<p>You see, most of our life depends on how we see it. If we see getting a parking ticket as a bad thing, it becomes a bad thing. But if we are able to see it as building patients, it can become a positive thing; that is, if we want to be more patient. For now, I think there might be enough time for another nap.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&#8220;Jesus loves me, this I know.  Just that sometimes, I have to go real slow.&#8221;</p>



<p>The trend has long been to do more, faster and better than before. I think we all feel the pressure in some way to get more done. Yet, even God took a day off.</p>



<p>There are at least a few ways to take a step back from our work. We just have to figure out what works best for us.</p>



<p>Plan ahead to do nothing. It could mean that you plan to set aside a few minutes each day, or it could mean that you plan to take a full day off each week. It also means figuring out what you may need to do or to put off in order to take this time.</p>



<p>By doing nothing, I don’t mean that you have to lie in bed and not move. What I’m talking about may look like one of the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Take a nap.</li>



<li>Call a friend.</li>



<li>Journal.</li>



<li>Pray or pick up a Bible.</li>



<li>Draw, crochet, cook or something else.</li>



<li>Take a leisurely walk.</li>
</ul>



<p>These are just a few ideas. The thing is that some of us — myself included — have to plan things or else they just don’t happen. And, for me, even putting something on a to-do list dues’t guarantee that it will get done.</p>



<p>The thing is to do something that you will enjoy doing. And keep it simple. Don’t think, as I some times do, my neighbor’s lawn needs cleaning, so I’m going to take care of that. Yes, there is a time for these things, but it cannot replace taking at least a little time to replenish ourselves.</p>



<p>Can taking time off be taken to extremes? Yes, everything can. That’s probably why God limited it to one day. And when God gave us 10 commandments, taking time off was just one of them — and not even the first.</p>



<p>We can keep ourselves so busy that we forget what we are doing it for. What we do, we should do out of love. Whether it’s working or taking time to help someone else, cooking, drawing or helping little old ladies across the street, we should do it out of love.</p>



<p>Remember, God loved us so much that He sent His one and only son to die for us so that He could restore a broken relationship between us. Yes, God had to plan ahead. He had to sacrifice something He loved. But He loved us that much.</p>

<p>What is the most important system in our body? Is it the nervous system. Maybe it’s the respiratory system or the system of veins and arteries that carries blood through our bodies. The truth is that every part of our body serves some sort of function. And, though, we can live without certain parts of our body, no part of the body can be discounted as unimportant.</p>



<p>Our nervous system not only allows us to do all of the things that we do consciously but also runs the parts of the body that happen without out thinking about them.</p>



<p>Our digestive system takes nutrients and helps feed each and every cell of our body, and it is the blood that is carried though veins that brings this food to the cells.</p>



<p>It is the respiratory system that brings oxygen to our cells, without which we cannot survive. But even the smallest part of our body serve a purpose.</p>



<p>The human body is pretty forgiving, allowing us to make unwise choices for some time. Yet, over time, these choices take a toll on our body. Smoking limits our ability to breath properly, poor diet choices can lead to having extra weight, diabetes, and other issues. A lack of exercise can also negatively affect our health and, as we get older, it can be difficult to overcome the effects of the choices that we have made in the past.</p>



<p>Think of it as financial investing. The earlier we get started making the right choices, the better off we will be in the long run. That isn’t to say that things don’t happen that are out of our control. Cancer can come along and take anyone down. Sickness and disease don’t care who you are. But the better we take care of ourselves, the better the choices that we make, the better a chance of living healthy lives as we grow older.</p>



<p>Here is another: “Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.” — Exodus 20:12 (KJV) How we treat others, especially our parents, has an impact on our health. Our thought lead to actions, our actions lead to routines and our routines help determine our quality of life.</p>



<p>And don’t forget sleep. Our bodies also need rest. On the seventh day, God rested from the work that he had done, and our bodies and minds need rest too. Speaking of which, I think there’s still enough time for a nap.</p>
