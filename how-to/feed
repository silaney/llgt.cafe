<p>&#8220;Jesus loves me, this I know.  Just that sometimes, I have to go real slow.&#8221;</p>



<p>The trend has long been to do more, faster and better than before. I think we all feel the pressure in some way to get more done. Yet, even God took a day off.</p>



<p>There are at least a few ways to take a step back from our work. We just have to figure out what works best for us.</p>



<p>Plan ahead to do nothing. It could mean that you plan to set aside a few minutes each day, or it could mean that you plan to take a full day off each week. It also means figuring out what you may need to do or to put off in order to take this time.</p>



<p>By doing nothing, I don’t mean that you have to lie in bed and not move. What I’m talking about may look like one of the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Take a nap.</li>



<li>Call a friend.</li>



<li>Journal.</li>



<li>Pray or pick up a Bible.</li>



<li>Draw, crochet, cook or something else.</li>



<li>Take a leisurely walk.</li>
</ul>



<p>These are just a few ideas. The thing is that some of us — myself included — have to plan things or else they just don’t happen. And, for me, even putting something on a to-do list dues’t guarantee that it will get done.</p>



<p>The thing is to do something that you will enjoy doing. And keep it simple. Don’t think, as I some times do, my neighbor’s lawn needs cleaning, so I’m going to take care of that. Yes, there is a time for these things, but it cannot replace taking at least a little time to replenish ourselves.</p>



<p>Can taking time off be taken to extremes? Yes, everything can. That’s probably why God limited it to one day. And when God gave us 10 commandments, taking time off was just one of them — and not even the first.</p>



<p>We can keep ourselves so busy that we forget what we are doing it for. What we do, we should do out of love. Whether it’s working or taking time to help someone else, cooking, drawing or helping little old ladies across the street, we should do it out of love.</p>



<p>Remember, God loved us so much that He sent His one and only son to die for us so that He could restore a broken relationship between us. Yes, God had to plan ahead. He had to sacrifice something He loved. But He loved us that much.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Do you enjoy cooking, or is it a chore? Have you been cooking for some time, or are you still new at it? I enjoy cooking, especially for others. If I’m cooking for myself, I still tend to cook in large batches and put whatever I cook in the refrigerator to eat throughout the week.</p>



<p>If you don’t care to cook, however or, if you are still new at it, here are a few tips.</p>



<p>Start at the library. Depending on the size of your library, there may to cookbooks numbering in the hundreds. It is one of the favorite subjects for people to write about. What you are looking for is ideas and, maybe a recipe or two. My library is curb side service only, making it harder to brows the cookbook section, but I’m sure that if I go online, I could find a book to check out.</p>



<p>Speaking of online, there are a number of online resources. YouTube and Amazon are just a couple of them. YouTube will show you not only the things that you will need, but will nearly always show you step by step the directions for making whatever it is that you want to make.</p>



<p>One of the keys to learning how to cook is technique. Learning technique, such as creaming butter and sugar together as the first step to baking, can help a great deal in the cooking process. Practicing knife skills can also lend to more beautiful presentation in your cooking, and you can learn all of this, free, online.</p>



<p>Knowing what spices and spice combinations work, and using these spices in your cooking, can also add a great deal of flavor to your cooking. Nutmeg is a wonderful spice to cook with, but you need to know when to use it, and how much to add to your recipe. Because it is such a strong spice, you only want to use a small amount, usually around 1/8 of a teaspoon. The same is true for cayenne pepper, but you likely won’t use these two ingredients in the same recipe.</p>



<p>It’s important to know the difference between spices and herbs. While spices tend to go into a recipe at the beginning of the cooking process, herbs tend to go in near the end, or even after cooking has been completed. The flavor of spices changes over time, while the more delicate herbs tend to loose their flavor fairly quickly. The best way to learn how to use these items is though actual practice. That way, you can find out what flavors that you like most as well as which ones you don’t really care for.</p>



<p>Here are a couple of other tips.</p>



<p>Plan ahead. It will save you both time and money if you are able to plan your meals ahead of time. Yes, you can save a lot of time buying frozen dinners and ordering out, but a home make meal is likely to be a lot better for you, and just might taste batter.</p>



<p>When you are preparing a recipe, gather everything that you will need into one place. Familiarize yourself with the recipe and do your best to understand what you will need to do and when. Give yourself time, and try to make sure that you are not interrupted during the process. There’s little worse than having to leave what you are working on and returning to find out that all of your labor (and food) has been wasted.</p>



<p>Take your time and taste as you go. As noted above, spies can change over time. A little cayenne pepper may not taste so strong now, but given an hour or so will probably increase in intensity. Remember that you can always add more but you cannot take out. There are tricks to reducing heat and over salting, but it’s best to not make these mistakes in the first place.</p>



<p>Enjoy the process. You may cook for yourself, or you may cook for others. The food that took so long to cook may last only minutes, and those whom you cook for may or may not thank you for your efforts. Yet, if you can enjoy the process, from start to finish, then it can make all of your effort well worth it, especially if you can enjoy the results at the end.</p>



<p>Try finding someone else to cook with. Cooking with a friend or family member might be more fun.</p>



<p>If all else fails, read the directions. Find a recipe that you might be interested in cooking and look it up. There are almost always recipes online and YouTube is another source that can give you a visual demonstration of just about any recipe out there.</p>



<p>Finally, if you can and, unless you enjoy doing so, find someone else to wash the dishes. The cook shouldn’t also have to do the dishes. Yes, I’ve had to do the dishes countless times over my career in food services, but it is my least favorite part of cooking.</p>



<p>Perhaps you have some of your own ideas. If so, please feel free to share them below. Cooking can be a rewarding endeavor, but it can also be a lonely one. I would love to hear from you.</p>

<p>Feeling stuck. Not sure how to get out of the daily grind? Maybe you just want to try something different but aren’t sure where to start. Here are some ideas that may help.</p>



<p>Start small. Take a moment to write down a list of things that you would like to start doing: exercising, eating more vegetables, remembering to feed your dog, for example. Find a place to put this list where you can see this list each morning and throughout the day. I have mine on a dry eras board. If you want to walk each day, start out with a two to ten minute walk. On weekends, I may walk three hours or more, but I try to walk a little each day, even if it’s to the fridge.</p>



<p>Try joining a church, a church small group for larger churches, or a club. Volunteer for a local charity or for the library. There are so many organizations that can use volunteer help.</p>



<p>Seek a new job/career or get a second job. You may have to do this if you loose your current job for whatever reason. Hopefully, this doesn’t happen, but it happens all the time. It can seem like a good thing, but often, it does’t. Either way, put your energy into finding something new and, if possible, exciting.</p>



<p>Take up a hobby. There are so many to choose from. Just within art there is photography, watercolor, pastel, color pencil, charcoal, those little fluffy things and so much more. You may even want to take a class that can help you learn a craft and may help you meet others who are also interested in art.</p>



<p>Teach a class. I found a local store, Natural Grocers, that allows me to use their kitchen to teach a class. They also provide me with up to $100 groceries to use as a demo. They do have rules that I am required to follow but nothing too difficult. I’ve only done one class but another is scheduled for next month. Just make sure that, if you decide to teach your class that you know your subject. Curiosity helps, too.</p>



<p>Find others to go for walks with. There may be a local photography club, too, as well as writers and speakers clubs. You should be able to do a Google search for local clubs.</p>



<p>The greatest/best change in my life came when I put my faith in Jesus to pay my sin debt and restore a relationship with God. John 3:16 (KJV) tells us that, <strong>“ For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”</strong> It gives us what we cannot earn and what none of us deserve: forgiveness, wholeness and eternal life. Some things, we get as soon as we accept God’s gift, while other things take a lifetime to change. A prayer of salvation is just the beginning.</p>



<p>Change can be hard at times, especially if it is forced on us. But it doesn’t have to be. It’s our decision as to whether we see change as a good or bad thing. Try to see it as a good thing. In one way, change will occur, with or without us.</p>



<p>Note: I’m not talking about some changes that others may try to force upon us. Even a lie can seem true if you hear it often enough. Keep an open mind to differing views and you should be able to decide what to think about differing issues on your own. Is there a write and wrong? In some cases, yes, but in others, no. You are the one who decides which is which, at least in your own mind. And this, too, may change over time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There are a lot of ways that you can spend time with and grow closer to friends and family. Below are just a few ideas.</p>



<p>Eat a meal together. October 11 is Southern Food Heritage Day, so cook or pick up some already prepared fried or baked chicken, a salad and some sort of dessert. You can eat outside or, if your weather is already still cold, you can eat inside.</p>



<p>Watch a movie or television together. Maybe you like classic movies, or the latest releases. Maybe you prefer watching football, baseball, or basketball. You can always find something to watch. You can even find something educational if you prefer and, if your library is open, you can usually find movies that you can borrow for free.</p>



<p>Go out. Depending on where you live, there may be a short time before the weather starts getting a lot colder. Lows in northern Idaho are already dipping into the mid 40s and will soon be in the 30s. But you can still go for a walk or ride bicycles or find some other outdoor activity.</p>



<p>Maybe you and your family or friends prefer to exercise your brains. Whether you prefer to debate, argue, or just discuss current issues, or whatever book you’ve been reading, there is a fair and amiable way to communicate with others, whether they agree with your view or not.</p>



<p>Create something. It doesn’t matter what you use — stone, wood, glass, paper and paint, wool, or flour and butter — there’s so much that you can make. You can make something for yourself, by yourself, or you can make something with others to give away as a gift. You might be surprised just how talented you are.</p>



<p>Volunteer. Give your time to a local charity or to help clean up part of your city or community. Your local chamber of commerce might be a good place to find volunteer opportunities.</p>



<p>Downsize. This last one isn’t really an activity, but it can bring your family together. I’ve heard more than once that some of the best times can be had when a family has less and that more can come often come from having less. Less space, less money, and fewer things can offer challenges that those who “have everything that they need” don’t have to face. If we have no challenges in our lives, we will quickly grow bored and might just find a way to create our own challenges, which may or may not turn us in a positive direction.</p>



<p>Whichever one you choose, or if you come up with your own idea, these things just don’t happen on their own. They have to be planned and planned for. You have to set aside time, and you have to have whatever is needed for that activity. I think, however, that you will find the time well worth the effort.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A lot of years ago, back when I was still in high school, I heard a story about a pilot who, when faced with loosing his own life or allowing his plane to crash into a crowd of onlookers, chose to stay with his plane and give up his own life. Back in his locker, as the story goes, they found a note that simply read, “I’m third.”</p>



<p>It’s a story that I’ve taken with me and, though it is unlikely that that I will ever find myself in a failing aircraft, facing the choice of my life or the lives of others, there is something that can be learned from this story.</p>



<p>Perhaps it’s something new or, more likely, it’s just a cycle that we’re going through. Slowly we begin to loose respect for life. It begins with those most in need: the elderly, the poor, those with special needs and the unborn. Not that I have anything against the American Bald Eagle, but when a person can serve more time for killing a Bald Eagle than for killing another human being, it seems that something just ain&#8217;t right.</p>



<p>Respect is something that has to be taught. It needs to be modeled it has to be demanded, or it won’t be passed on from one generation to the next. Not only do we have to put on a show for all to see but, more and more this seems to be come a me, or an i generation. My feeling is that those who model disrespect for anyone, especially those who do so in a public forum, out to be ashamed. And, yes, it goes both ways. It goes well beyond stimulus checks and money for the airlines. It’s all about the respect that we show or fail to show.</p>



<p>Realize it or not, when we devalue others, we are also devaluing ourselves. You can’t have one without the other. But we’re often so busy demanding our own say, shifting the blame, and wondering when someone else is going to make things right, that we fail to see our own part in the downward trend.</p>



<p>Maybe you were one of the lucky few who had a respect for others modeled for you. Excellent. Are you doing the best you can to model it for others? Believe it or not, showing others respect, even making yourself third, doesn’t in anyway diminish who you are. In fact, it could turn you from an i back to an I.</p>



<p>Exodus 20: 12 (KJV) says, “ Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.” Want to know how to live a long life? Respect others, starting with your parents. It’s pretty simple.</p>



<p>I’m not guaranteeing that anyone can change overnight. It’s taken me years, and I’m still working on building respect, not only for myself, but for others. Some times, it has to begin with forgiving others and, yes, forgetting any wrongs that may have been done to us. But even the longest journey has to begin somewhere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Question: How could two little words have so many meanings? But they do.</p>



<p>I remember that as a child, our family had a record player. It played 45’s and the records were about 1/3 the size of the larger records. The first record that I bought for myself was by Keith Green. I remember that I took all the money that I had at the time and — with the help of the cashier — purchased that album. I’m not sure how many times I listened to it but knowing me, it was probably several.</p>



<p>My brother, on the other hand, had a job and so he purchased a sound system. I liked to use it too. He preferred groups like Meatloaf and others that I don’t recall. I liked love songs from Styx, Chicago and Boston.</p>



<p>When CD’s came out, I got one. It took a while before I actually got a CD player. Or maybe it was the other way around.</p>



<p>My first CD was by Michael Card and I know I drove my sister crazy as I listened to it over and over. I know because she told me.</p>



<p>Keeping: having, owning, holding, possessing or maintaining. If you don’t keep something, you sell it or give it away.</p>



<p>Records: any document — printed material — mental, analog or digital. A record may be a physical piece of paper, but it may also be a memory, a 45 album or a photograph. These are just some examples. A $1 bill is a record of a certain percentage of value based on something. It used to be gold, but I’m not sure what it is now.</p>



<p>First Corinthians tells us that love, among other things, “it keeps no record of wrongs.” It tells us that we may have other gifts and we may do great things, “but do not have love, I gain nothing.”</p>



<p>The Bible also tells us that God is love. So, it could be said that if we do not have God, we do not have love and therefore we gain nothing from this life that we live.</p>



<p>What’s required to find God?</p>



<p>Scripture: it could be Genesis 1: 1 that says, “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.” (KJV)<br>Faith: so if you believe in your heart what God says, you have part of it.<br>Confession: It’s confession that, one, I am a sinner and that I need God’s help and, second, that I put my faith in the completed work of the only Son of God. If Jesus was just a teacher or a good guy, he could’t save anyone. And if you think about it, he really did clam to be equal to God and that’s why they killed Jesus.</p>



<p>I don’t remember my prayer because I was too shy to pray out loud. I did believe in my heart, though, and the confession came soon after at baptism. And, if you don’t know, baptism cannot save anyone. Tongues are not a sign of being born again; they are simply a gift for self edification and, perhaps, for the church. I think things like serving and teaching, giving to the church are more prevalent gifts these days. Healing would be nice, but I think it goes back to faith, not need.</p>



<p>Here’s a sample prayer: “God, forgive me. I confess that I am a sinner and that I need Your forgiveness. I accept your gift of salvation that you offer because of the promise in John 3: 16 (“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” — KJV). Thank you for this free gift.”</p>



<p>When you do this, you are sealed with the Holy Spirit, Saved and given eternal life. It’s so simple, and adult can get it.</p>



<p>If you have questions, please email me: ralfie517@gmail.com. Put “Question” in the “about” line. If you have a prayer request, put “Prayer”. If you just want to let me know that you’ve put your faith in Jesus, put “Yes.” This will help me sort though all of the junk that I get to find what I really need to focus on.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Warming: the following material could be heartbreaking. If you like, you may skip to the end.</strong></p>



<p>At Some point of our lives, each of us is a victim. It may be a crime, such as theft or vandalism. It may be abuse: sexual, emotional or physical. For all too many, life begins and ends with the abuse known as freedom of choice. Most of us just fall victim to the results of our own choices.</p>



<p>Each persons behavior is based on what he or she sees in other, on television and in movies, or listens to in the form of others or the music that that individual listens to. So someone who has been hurt by others — “You’re such a dummy” — is more likely to hurt others. Crime, gossip and abuse don’t begin with the act, they begin with a though.</p>



<p>“Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.” — Matthew 5: 21-22 (KJV)</p>



<p>God is much more concerned about our thoughts — our heart — than our our intents. It’s not intentions that lead to action; it’s our thoughts. We do, however, have the ability to stop when we see a negative though forming in our mind. We can stop and think. Unfortunately, not everyone realizes that he can change his thought pattern. And it we constantly feed on violence and a thought of hatred enters our mind, violence is likely to ensue.</p>



<p>It is important who and what we listen to. Television and movies are often meant to instill fear. They cause us to laugh at the wrong thing — mainly sin and perversion. Music can cause us to believe the wrong things, and material found of the Internet can cause thoughts of anything from fear to jealousy and lust.</p>



<p>Just one statistic shows that “22% of individuals assaulted by a partner at least once in their lifetime (23% for females and 19.3% for&nbsp; males).” Unfortunately wether the perpetrator realizes his/her abuse or not, whether the victim realizes their abuse or abuser or not, most people lack the resources to do anything. The sad part is that all too many victims are too young to recognize abuse and certainly too young to express what they may have experienced. “This must be normal,” one tells himself.</p>



<p><strong>You can pick up here if you like.</strong></p>



<p>I think I’ve made my point. At some time, each of us a victim. Now comes the choice: we say “Yes, I am a victim, and I deserve to be angry, resentful or bitter. Where’s my phone? I need to call a lawyer.” But that’s not the answer. What we should do is turn to the Savior: our Great Physician.</p>



<p>You can start wit the book of John <a href="http://Book of John https://content.wtsbooks.com/shopify/pdf_links/9781433558955f.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(PDF)</a>. Or you can start with verses like:</p>



<p>“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” — John 3:16 (KJV)</p>



<p>“That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” — Romans 10:9 (KJV)</p>



<p>Faith is a process that begins as a seed, takes root in the Word of God and beings to grow. A relationship with our Savior isn’t a religion and it’s not something that we can do on our own. We need to go to God and simply trust in the finished work of Jesus, his death on the cross to pay for our sins and his resurrection. We need to believe that Jesus, born of a virgin, lived a perfect and sinless life, was both fully God and fully man so that he could save us from our sins and restore the relationship with God that you and I truly long for.</p>



<p>It may begin with a prayer like this: “God, thank you for sending your only son to die to pay for my sins. I’m confessing that I’m a sinner and I ask you to forgive me, not because of anything that I do, but because of Jesus’ precious blood, spilt on a cross to pay my sin debt.”</p>



<p>What next: Find a church that teaches the Bible: preferably only the Bible, and doesn’t try to fill your mind with self help books and platitudes. If you find such a church, become a member. Hint, if the church is growing, it may be a good church. Visit that church and listen to who and what they talk about. Baptism is important, but not a requirement and it doesn’t give anyone eternal life. Spiritual gifts are a matter for another time.</p>



<p>If ever you feel threatened by someone or feel that your life may be in danger and cannot say, “I need the police to come help me,” dial 911 and press send. When the operator answers, say, “Yes, I’d like to order a pizza.” The operator with know what to do.</p>



<p>There are also videos that can help victims of abduction and sex trafficking: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GfsS4HH2Uw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Link to video</a></p>



<p>Parents should talk to their kids about what victimization looks like. Don’t frighten then but give them ideas of what they might do if someone approaches them. Practice situations that your child may experience and, by all means, keep lines of communication open, which means that you may have to confess your own faults and failures. After all, there’s no better teacher than personal experience. And admitting our own failures won’t kill us or make us look likes less of a person — except to the one who is out to get us.</p>

<p>There is help out there. If you see someone who looks like she needs help, take time to get to know that person. Ask questions.<br>If you could go anywhere in the world, where would you go?<br>What’s you’re favorite sport, color, food…<br>What are your plans for upcoming holiday/weekend?</p>



<p>Finally, be a friend. Find someone who seems isolated.  Offer her a Pop-tart a smile and some encouragement.  Find out what kind of music he or she likes. Just start talking. Just show that you care. And smile. Keep your smile, it still works and it looks good on you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Believe it or not, there may be something greater than having a lot of money, and that is the wisdom of knowing what to do with that money.</p>



<p>You may come across a lot of money at some point in your life but, if you lack the wisdom of knowing what to do with that money, it’s not likely to be around for very long. And if you lack the wisdom in your finances, it’s just at likely that having more money may be more trouble than it’s worth. Remember that money is nothing more than a tool, an indicator of where our heart is.</p>



<p>It may not be a lack of wisdom, though. It may be a lack of direction. And without a sense of direction, we are likely to waste our resources, going in every direction.</p>



<p>In order to find direction, we need to know where we want to go, and we need to know from where we are starting. After figuring out these two things, we need to create a plan that will take us from where we are to where we want to go.</p>



<p>Believe it or not, the bills that we need to pay first aren’t the credit card companies or even the rent, food, or the phone bill. The first bills that we need to pay are our tithe and ourselves. I know exactly how hard it is to do this, as I almost never pay myself, and all too often, I fail to tithe. It’s not that I don’t want to do either, but it’s easy to think that I will pay myself if there is anything left over at the end (and there never is), and that God can handle things for a while.</p>



<p>The easy part is figuring out where you want to go. The next part is almost as easy, and it’s to create a budget. But remember that you have to include everything. If you don’t include everything, you are much less likely to stick with the budget that you have created.</p>



<p>At some point, you will need to figure out where you are. You can do that, now, or you can wait till you have an emergency fund set up. This emergency fund should contain at least $1,000 or three or more months of living expenses. No, it’s not easy, but it won’t be easy getting by if you don’t have the money and an emergency arises. I never studied law, but Murphy’s Law states that “emergencies will often happen at the worst possible time.”</p>



<p>The hardest part is actually sticking to the budget that you have carefully crafted. You may find it helpful to print out a copy or to write it on an index card so that you can carry it around with you. Better yet, use cash for things like groceries, travel expenses and entertainment. Don’t reach for the bank card unless you have money in your account earmarked for the item or items that you are purchasing, and never use a credit card for conveniences.</p>



<p>Another tip, if you are able to do so is to have an automatic payment go either to savings or to another account. This is something that you can do once and forget, and it will be one less thing that you will have to worry about.</p>



<p>One warning: No amount of money, whether it be small or great, is worth loosing your eternal soul. it’s not that having money will cost you your soul but, rather, being self sufficient can blind people to their need for a Savior.</p>



<p>It’s easy to get stuck in the trap of never having any money, and it’s a hole that can be hard to dig out of, especially if there is the added weight of debt and/or the increased cost of living. Add to that, the fact that many of us have lost our jobs or are going back to jobs with either lower wages or reduced hours, and it makes the work all the more difficult. Just remember that difficult does not equate to impossible and, if you work at it long enough and with enough determination, nothing is impossible.</p>

<p>So, here’s a question: I’m told that we carry a lot in our DNA. I’ve heard that even parts of our personality can be found in an individual’s DNA. I’ve also heard that trauma can affect an individuals DNA that can passed down generation after generation.</p>



<p>So, my first question is this: if both sides of a family suffered trauma — say WWII for example and the killing of millions of the people of at least one of them, might this DNA be passed on to following generations?</p>



<p>Here’s another question? How far might this DNA go back? Adam must have been traumatized when he was evicted — by God himself — from the only land he had ever know. How about Eve? I mean, I really hate snakes.</p>



<p>Able received a fatal head trauma and I doubt he recovered from that. Could that still affect modern medicine as we know it today? I don’t know.</p>



<p>Jacob had to leave his fairly and forfeit everything that he had worked so hard to steal from his brother. He did get his dad’s blessing, but you cannot pack that in carry on. Then, in turn, he was tricked by another family member. And his wife nearly died after she stole the family gods. Plus, he had his brother to deal with on the journey home — the one that never happened.</p>



<p>David lost at least two sons and had a man killed mob style after David slept with his wife. I know the guilt was eating him alive. And don’t forget King Saul who had to have gotten really ticked at times: enough to try to hunt down and kill young David — all because of a little envy and greed.</p>



<p>Here’s a question or two: you have no doubt seen the nude statue of young David. It’s a nude and larger than life. Did he pose for that, and would it be considered child abuse? Just kidding. The statue came long after David died and there would be no surviving pictures from that time.</p>



<p>There are others: Daniel had to face the lions. Moses killed a nan and had to leave everything that he was familiar with. Mary had to face her family with unexpected news. Many were killed, and that has to have an affect on someone’s life.</p>



<p>In high school, I had a very wise vice principal who once asked me how I managed to, not only graduate with honors but receive an invitation to intern in Washington DC. I don’t know the answer to either one. My mom wouldn’t let me take the internship.</p>



<p>We can look at these events in horror — letting the adrenal gland overpower our emotions (this takes about a minute, I hear). That’s one option. Or we can stop and, after taking a deep breath ask ourselves if what we think we are experiencing is real or not. Or we can thank God for protecting us from what might have happened. In particular, I’m thinking of a car that nearly ran me over. I was in the crosswalk and the driver made an illegal turn. But it happened so quickly, that I had no time to react. Yes, God was watching out for me and I knew it.</p>



<p>You see, as I told Sandy, hurt people hurt people. If someone hurts me — or in the case of the transfer of information through DNA — if someone hurt my mom or dad, I might suffer for it. Might I, in turn make others suffer for what my parent had experienced. It’s a valid question and is worth at least a moment of pondering.</p>



<p>I believe, though it’s not stated in the Bible, is that what that small piece of fruit might have done was to change the DNA of man and woman. I believe that Adam missed what he had so much that his loss was very traumatic. Did Adam and Eve eventually part ways after a big fight?</p>



<p>I also believe that when we are born again — and Jesus did say that we “must” be born again — that God somehow renews our DNA. The Bible does call the believer a “new creation.” What does this mean, you may ask? It means that we don’t have to follow our own inclinations to do evil. Now, we may still choose evil but, even as a believer, there will be consequences. Believe it or not, they now now that even premarital sex can lead to pregnancy. No lie.</p>



<p>So, what do we do with all of this information? If we not born again, a good place to start with is a prayer of repentance. A simple “God help me” will suffice, if it comes with faith that God actually will help. If, however, you are praying “God, help me win the $100 million dollar lottery,” you’re on you own.</p>



<p>If you are a believer, a prayer of thanksgiving will do wonders. I was helping direct traffic at church on Sunday. Soon, I was doing a signaling motion that resembled that of a music conductor and I thought to myself: “They’re playing God’s songs, these cars they are.”</p>



<p>I like to keep all questions till later — keeping them in the back of my mind until I’ve had time to sort them out. That’s how I often work best. After all, there may be a simple answer to the questions that I’ve so long pondered. I put everything out on the table — so to speak — until I’m able to mentally process it. This is an exercise that can take longer than anyone might anticipate, depending on one’s openness to the Holy Spirit. I’m working on it. I am, after all, a work in progress. I thank God that he uses a work in progress or W.I.P. like me and not a whip.</p>

<p>Meeting new people isn’t always as easy as it seems, and making new friends is even more difficult. As we grow, and our lives become busier and busier, it can be hard to find time to expand our inner circle of friends. As tech replaces human contact, there are still ways of interacting with others in person. There are plenty ways to meet new people: here are 10 of them.</p>



<p><strong>Join a club</strong><br>This could be anything from a book reading club to a motorcycle club. Search online for a local club, by using searches on Google or Facebook, or some other search engine. Certain clubs may require a minimum skill level or the ownership of required equipment (example: if you don’t own a camera, you will probably want to buy one before joining a photo club, though, a smart phone may work just fine.) Club size may also be limited, and it might be important to find out when and where meetings will be held, in case there is a time or any other conflicts.</p>



<p><strong>Join a sports team</strong><br>A team differs from a club in that they tend to get together on a weekly or monthly basis, or practice or for competition. Teams might include games such as basketball, baseball, soccer, and bowling. Though not a team sport, gold is another viable option.</p>



<p><strong>Take a second job, or do volunteer work</strong><br>Get paid to meet others, or do it for free. It may be difficult to find an organization that needs your help and/or your particular skill set, but keep looking. It took me nearly six months to find a place to volunteer in my new home. There are countless ways to find new jobs (indeed.com is just one option.) And if an online search doesn’t help with finding a place to volunteer, the local chamber of commerce may be able to help.</p>



<p><strong>Walk at the park or mall</strong><br>Though it’s possible to walk almost anywhere, it might be best to choose a place that has more people, such as a mall or park. These areas may not only have more people, they are also designed for walking.</p>



<p><strong>Visit your neighbor</strong><br>If you have a new neighbor, or if you are new in an area, just say hi. It may not be possible to knock on a neighbor’s door; it may be more appropriate to start a conversation at the edge of your own property. If you feel comfortable knocking on your neighbor’s door, you may want to bring a gift, such as something that you have baked, or something that you’ve grown in your garden. Just being outside, working on a car or working in a garden may be enough to meet new people.</p>



<p><strong>Take a class</strong><br>There are several ways to find a local classes. Schools, libraries, co-ops, and specialty stores are just a few places that can offer classes. Cooking, art, gardening and bee keeping are just a few examples. And if you cannot find a class that you are interested, consider teaching one, if you can find a place to meet and a subject that your audience is interested in. It may even be possible to make some extra money.</p>



<p><strong>Throw a party, or invite friends to a picnic</strong><br>Picnics are great ways to meet people, as are parties. Food and drinks can be provided free, for a small fee, or done potluck style. Picnics can be done at home, at a park or a beach. Parties can be held indoors or outdoors, at restaurants or in a hall. Parties, however, may require a month or more of more of planning, with at least one person being committed to planning the party. A street party, for example, may require contacting city planning in order to get permits, and rentals may be another consideration.</p>



<p><strong>Play bingo</strong><br>There may be a local bingo club. I know if a local casino that offers bingo on weekends, and have seen gatherings at malls and shopping centers. Bingo night may be listed online or advertised on a bulletin board.</p>



<p><strong>Shop yard sales</strong><br>Yard sales can be great opportunities to meet new people. You can either set up your own yard sale or shop the sales of others. Yard sales are great because they are often more casual than grocery or big box stores. And, if you find something that you like, it’s usually less expensive.</p>



<p><strong>Go to church or attend church functions</strong><br>Even a town as small as 200 people can have as many as six church, and one of them is likely to meet your spiritual needs. Though a church may not meet for anything other than a church service, or be so large that it can be difficult to meet new people, many offer smaller meeting others through small groups.</p>



<p>Bulletin boards, newspapers, and word of mouth are just a few ways of finding ideas for meeting new people. In addition, there are plenty of online resources. Find or create a website for a local club, or use Facebook, and there are also online dating sites. Most times the best way to make new friends is to just be friendly.</p>
